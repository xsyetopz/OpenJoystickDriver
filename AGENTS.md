# AGENTS.md

OpenJoystickDriver is a macOS userspace gamepad driver. Keep changes grounded in
current source, controller profile schemas, and observed hardware behavior.

## Source of Truth

- Runtime profiles: `Sources/OpenJoystickDriverKit/Resources/Controllers/*.json`
- Device schemas: `Resources/Schemas/Devices/*.json`
- JSON schemas: `Resources/Schemas/*.schema.json`
- Build/signing scripts: `scripts/ojd` and `scripts/ojd-*.sh`
- Swift package graph: `Package.swift`
- DriverKit project: `DriverKitExtension/`

You must not document behavior as supported unless production code, schemas,
tests, or manual hardware notes in this repo support it.

For the current user-facing feature matrix, see `docs/COMPATIBILITY_LAYERS.md`.

## Edit Rules

- Keep local `$schema` references out of committed JSON. Use
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xsyetopz/OpenJoystickDriver/main/...`.
- Add one controller profile per device under
  `Sources/OpenJoystickDriverKit/Resources/Controllers/`.
- Add a matching `Resources/Schemas/Devices/*.json` file for GIP controllers.
- Use decimal VID, PID, endpoint, and packet values in JSON files.
- Keep protocol variants and mapping flags in data where possible; you must not bake device quirks into parser code unless the protocol requires it.
- Avoid broad rewrites of signing, DriverKit, or daemon lifecycle code without targeted checks.

## Checks

Run focused checks for the touched surface through RTK filters instead of
`rtk proxy`, because proxy tracks raw output and can collapse project savings:

```bash
rtk ./scripts/ojd check profiles
rtk test swift test
rtk err bash -n scripts/ojd scripts/ojd-*.sh
```

If `swift test` fails with a SwiftPM module-cache mismatch (for example
`_Testing_Foundation` minimum deployment target errors), run
`./scripts/ojd repair swiftpm-module-cache` and rerun the test.

For backend/runtime changes, also use compact diagnostics:

```bash
rtk ./scripts/ojd diag backends --seconds 5
rtk ./scripts/ojd diag gamecontroller --seconds 5
rtk ./scripts/ojd diag sdl3 --seconds 10
```

Use `rtk summary <cmd>` for one-off noisy runtime probes, `rtk log` or
`rtk pipe --filter ...` for captured logs, and `rtk run <cmd>` only when raw
execution should intentionally avoid filtering and tracking. You must not use
`rtk proxy` for routine tests, checks, app binary runs, `launchctl`, or `log show` diagnostics.

This repo has project-local filters in `.rtk/filters.toml`. Install or append the managed common filters idempotently with:

```bash
./scripts/ojd rtk install-filters
```

After changing filters, run:

```bash
rtk trust
rtk verify --require-all
rtk discover --project OpenJoystickDriver
RTK_HOOK_AUDIT=1 rtk hook-audit
```

DriverKit, signing, notarization, TCC permissions, and real controller input may require local macOS hardware confirmation. CI cannot prove those end to end.

## Known Runtime Caveat

Compatibility mode can still create a stale, non-working first controller instance in browser Gamepad API pages. Treat that as a runtime/backend issue, not as evidence that the controller profile mapping is wrong.

## Documentation Surfaces

- `README.md` is the human entry point.
- `llms.txt` is concise LLM context.
- `llms-full.txt` is expanded LLM context.
- `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` should remain symlinks to `AGENTS.md`.
