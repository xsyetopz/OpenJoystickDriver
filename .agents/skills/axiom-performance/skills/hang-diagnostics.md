# Hang Diagnostics

Systematic diagnosis and resolution of app hangs. A hang occurs when the main thread is blocked for more than 1 second, making the app unresponsive to user input.

## Why xcsym rejected my hang .ips

xcsym's `crash` subcommand explicitly rejects `.ips` files of type `hang` because hang analysis has a different workflow from crash analysis. If xcsym returned `{"error":"hang_report"}` (bug_type=298), you're in the right place — this skill is the authoritative path for hang diagnosis. See `axiom-tools (skills/xcsym-ref.md)` for the crash-focused workflow.

## Red Flags — Check This Skill When

| Symptom | This Skill Applies |
|---------|-------------------|
| App freezes briefly during use | Yes — likely hang |
| UI doesn't respond to touches | Yes — main thread blocked |
| "App not responding" system dialog | Yes — severe hang |
| Xcode Organizer shows hang diagnostics | Yes — field hang reports |
| MetricKit MXHangDiagnostic received | Yes — aggregated hang data |
| Animations stutter or skip | Maybe — could be hitch, not hang |
| App feels slow but responsive | No — performance issue, not hang |

## What Is a Hang

A **hang** is when the main runloop cannot process events for more than 1 second. The user taps, but nothing happens.

```
User taps → Main thread busy/blocked → Event queued → 1+ second delay → HANG
```

**Key distinction**: The main thread handles ALL user input. If it's busy or blocked, the entire UI freezes.

### Hang vs Hitch vs Lag

| Issue | Duration | User Experience | Tool |
|-------|----------|-----------------|------|
| **Hang** | >1 second | App frozen, unresponsive | Time Profiler, System Trace |
| **Hitch** | 1-3 frames (16-50ms) | Animation stutters | Animation Hitches instrument |
| **Lag** | 100-500ms | Feels slow but responsive | Time Profiler |

**This skill covers hangs.** For hitches, see `axiom-swiftui` (performance reference). For general lag, see `axiom-performance (skills/performance-profiling.md)`.

## The Two Causes of Hangs

Every hang has one of two root causes:

### 1. Main Thread Busy

The main thread is doing work instead of processing events.

**Subcategories**:

| Type | Example | Fix |
|------|---------|-----|
| **Proactive work** | Pre-computing data user hasn't requested | Lazy initialization, compute on demand |
| **Irrelevant work** | Processing all notifications, not just relevant ones | Filter notifications, targeted observers |
| **Suboptimal API** | Using blocking API when async exists | Switch to async API |

### 2. Main Thread Blocked

The main thread is waiting for something else.

**Subcategories**:

| Type | Example | Fix |
|------|---------|-----|
| **Synchronous IPC** | Calling system service synchronously | Use async API variant |
| **File I/O** | `Data(contentsOf:)` on main thread | Move to background queue |
| **Network** | Synchronous URL request | Use URLSession async |
| **Lock contention** | Waiting for lock held by background thread | Reduce critical section, use actors |
| **Semaphore/dispatch_sync** | Blocking on background work | Restructure to async completion |

## Decision Tree — Diagnosing Hangs

```
START: App hangs reported
  │
  ├─→ Do you have hang diagnostics from Organizer or MetricKit?
  │     │
  │     ├─→ YES: Examine stack trace
  │     │     │
  │     │     ├─→ Stack shows your code running
  │     │     │     → BUSY: Main thread doing work
  │     │     │     → Profile with Time Profiler
  │     │     │
  │     │     └─→ Stack shows waiting (semaphore, lock, dispatch_sync)
  │     │           → BLOCKED: Main thread waiting
  │     │           → Profile with System Trace
  │     │
  │     └─→ NO: Can you reproduce?
  │           │
  │           ├─→ YES: Profile with Time Profiler first
  │           │     │
  │           │     ├─→ High CPU on main thread
  │           │     │     → BUSY: Optimize the work
  │           │     │
  │           │     └─→ Low CPU, thread blocked
  │           │           → Use System Trace to find what's blocking
  │           │
  │           └─→ NO: Enable MetricKit in app
  │                 → Wait for field reports
  │                 → Check Organizer > Hangs
```

## Tool Selection

| Scenario | Primary Tool | Why |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| **Reproduces locally** | Time Profiler | See exactly what main thread is doing |
| **Blocked thread suspected** | System Trace | Shows thread state, lock contention |
| **Field reports only** | Xcode Organizer | Aggregated hang diagnostics |
| **Want in-app data** | MetricKit | MXHangDiagnostic with call stacks |
| **Need precise timing** | System Trace | Nanosecond-level thread analysis |
| **Re-scope a known hang to app code** | xcprof | Auto-flags candidate stalls; `--start-ms/--end-ms` window + `--user-binary` attribution (see Hang Window Workflow) |
| **User can reproduce, you can't** | sysdiagnose triggered during the hang | Stackshot has per-thread backtraces of every process (see Getting Hang Data from End Users) |

## Time Profiler Workflow for Hangs

1. **Launch Instruments** → Select Time Profiler template
2. **Record during hang** → Reproduce the freeze
3. **Stop recording** → Find the hang period in timeline
4. **Select hang region** → Drag to select frozen timespan
5. **Examine call tree** → Look for main thread work

**What to look for**:
- Functions with high "Self Time" on main thread
- Unexpectedly deep call stacks
- System calls that shouldn't be on main thread

## Hang Window Workflow

`xcprof analyze` runs main-thread hang detection automatically on every invocation (not opt-in): the `## Main thread (approximate)` section reports the largest gap between consecutive main-thread samples (`max gap`) and a `candidate stalls` count — a strong signal that a hang occurred and how long the worst one was. It's *approximate* because cpu-profile only samples running threads, so a large gap is a candidate stall, not a confirmed one. The actionable follow-up is to re-scope to the hang window and attribute the samples to your own code.

**Step 1 — Bound the window.** xcprof reports the stall's *duration* (`max gap`), not its start time, so estimate the window from when you observed the freeze: a MetricKit hang report's timestamp, a user-visible stall, or the Instruments timeline (`--open`). Example: a ~5s freeze around the 2s mark → window ≈ 2000–7000ms.

**Step 2 — Re-scope and attribute to app code.**

```sh
xcprof analyze MyApp.trace \
  --start-ms 2000 --end-ms 7000 \
  --user-binary MyApp
```

`--start-ms`/`--end-ms` restrict the sample set to that window (echoed back as a `scope:` line). The `## Top user-code frames` table is emitted on every run; `--user-binary` (comma-separated) just *sharpens* it — narrowing user-code attribution to the named binaries plus the recording target, so the table lists your app's functions instead of every non-system frame.

**Expected output** (shape — real output is markdown sections + tables):

```
## Summary
- duration: 12.400s · mode: immediate · end: time-limit
- scope: 2000–7000ms (812 samples in window)

## Main thread (approximate)
- samples: 812 · cpu share: 71.2% · max gap: 4980ms (threshold 250ms) · candidate stalls: 1

## Top user-code frames
| function | binary | self | inclusive |
|---|---|---|---|
| ImageStore.thumbnail(for:) | MyApp | 58.0% (~2900ms) | 62.0% (~3100ms) |
| FeedView.body.getter | MyApp | 12.0% (~600ms) | 24.0% (~1200ms) |
```

The answer is now "`ImageStore.thumbnail(for:)` runs ~2.9s on the main thread" (→ move the decode off-main), not an opaque deepest system frame.

> Release builds without symbols attribute nothing ("none attributed"). Pass `--dsym <path>` (or rely on Spotlight UUID discovery) so frames resolve to names.

## System Trace Workflow for Blocked Hangs

1. **Launch Instruments** → Select System Trace template
2. **Record during hang** → Capture thread states
3. **Find main thread** → Filter to main thread
4. **Look for red/orange** → Blocked states
5. **Examine blocking reason** → Lock, semaphore, IPC

**Thread states**:
- **Running (blue)**: Executing code
- **Preempted (orange)**: Runnable but not scheduled
- **Blocked (red)**: Waiting for resource

## Common Hang Patterns and Fixes

### Pattern 1: Synchronous File I/O

**Before (hangs)**:
```swift
// Main thread blocks on file read
func loadUserData() {
    let data = try! Data(contentsOf: largeFileURL)  // BLOCKS
    processData(data)
}
```

**After (async)**:
```swift
func loadUserData() {
    // `Task.detached` is intentional — `Task {}` would inherit the caller's
    // @MainActor isolation and run the file I/O on main. In Swift 6.2+,
    // prefer marking a helper `@concurrent` instead of detached.
    Task.detached {
        let data = try Data(contentsOf: largeFileURL)
        await MainActor.run {
            self.processData(data)
        }
    }
}
```

### Pattern 2: Unfiltered Notification Observer

**Before (processes all)**:
```swift
NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(
    self,
    selector: #selector(handleChange),
    name: .NSManagedObjectContextObjectsDidChange,
    object: nil  // Receives ALL contexts
)
```

**After (filtered)**:
```swift
NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(
    self,
    selector: #selector(handleChange),
    name: .NSManagedObjectContextObjectsDidChange,
    object: relevantContext  // Only this context
)
```

### Pattern 3: Expensive Formatter Creation

**Before (creates each time)**:
```swift
func formatDate(_ date: Date) -> String {
    let formatter = DateFormatter()  // EXPENSIVE
    formatter.dateStyle = .medium
    return formatter.string(from: date)
}
```

**After (cached)**:
```swift
private static let dateFormatter: DateFormatter = {
    let formatter = DateFormatter()
    formatter.dateStyle = .medium
    return formatter
}()

func formatDate(_ date: Date) -> String {
    Self.dateFormatter.string(from: date)
}
```

### Pattern 4: dispatch_sync to Main Thread

**Before (deadlock risk)**:
```swift
// From background thread
DispatchQueue.main.sync {  // BLOCKS if main is blocked
    updateUI()
}
```

**After (async)**:
```swift
DispatchQueue.main.async {
    self.updateUI()
}
```

### Pattern 5: Semaphore for Async Result

**Before (blocks main thread)**:
```swift
func fetchDataSync() -> Data {
    let semaphore = DispatchSemaphore(value: 0)
    var result: Data?

    URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { data, _, _ in
        result = data
        semaphore.signal()
    }.resume()

    semaphore.wait()  // BLOCKS MAIN THREAD
    return result!
}
```

**After (async/await)**:
```swift
func fetchData() async throws -> Data {
    let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
    return data
}
```

### Pattern 6: Lock Contention

**Before (shared lock)**:
```swift
class DataManager {
    private let lock = NSLock()
    private var cache: [String: Data] = [:]

    func getData(for key: String) -> Data? {
        lock.lock()  // Main thread waits for background
        defer { lock.unlock() }
        return cache[key]
    }
}
```

**After (actor)**:
```swift
actor DataManager {
    private var cache: [String: Data] = [:]

    func getData(for key: String) -> Data? {
        cache[key]  // Actor serializes access safely
    }
}
```

### Pattern 7: App Launch Hang (Watchdog)

**Before (too much work)**:
```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                 didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    loadAllUserData()      // Expensive
    setupAnalytics()       // Network calls
    precomputeLayouts()    // CPU intensive
    return true
}
```

**After (deferred)**:
```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                 didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    // Only essential setup
    setupMinimalUI()
    return true
}

func applicationDidBecomeActive(_ application: UIApplication) {
    // Defer non-essential work
    Task {
        await loadUserDataInBackground()
    }
}
```

### Pattern 8: Image Processing on Main Thread

**Before (blocks UI)**:
```swift
func processImage(_ image: UIImage) {
    let filtered = applyExpensiveFilter(image)  // BLOCKS
    imageView.image = filtered
}
```

**After (background processing)**:
```swift
func processImage(_ image: UIImage) {
    imageView.image = placeholder

    // `Task.detached` here because the enclosing function is @MainActor-isolated;
    // `Task {}` would inherit isolation and run the filter on main. In Swift 6.2+,
    // prefer making the filter `@concurrent` and using a regular `Task {}`.
    Task.detached(priority: .userInitiated) {
        let filtered = applyExpensiveFilter(image)
        await MainActor.run {
            self.imageView.image = filtered
        }
    }
}
```

## Xcode Organizer Hang Diagnostics

**Window > Organizer > Select App > Hangs**

The Organizer shows aggregated hang data from users who opted into sharing diagnostics.

**Reading the report**:
1. **Hang Rate**: Hangs per day per device
2. **Call Stack**: Where the hang occurred
3. **Device/OS breakdown**: Which configurations affected

**Interpreting call stacks**:
- **Your code at top**: Main thread busy with your work
- **System API at top**: You called blocking API on main thread
- **pthread_mutex/semaphore**: Lock contention or explicit waiting

The Xcode 27 Organizer goes further: the redesigned Overview pairs the hang-rate chart with the underlying diagnostics on one screen, Metric Goals calibrate an achievable hang-rate target against similar apps and your own baselines, and **Generate Recommendations** runs an agentic analysis over the diagnostic data to localize the hang and propose fixes. A new hitches metric also surfaces choppy animations beyond scrolling. See `axiom-performance (skills/performance-profiling.md)` for the Instruments-27 side (Swift executors instrument for main-actor congestion, Inspector for blocked-thread syscalls).

## MetricKit Hang Diagnostics

On the 27 cycle, hang diagnostics arrive as typed `DiagnosticReport` values (`OS27` — not watchOS/tvOS):

```swift
import MetricKit

let manager = MetricManager()   // keep alive

for await report in manager.diagnosticReports {
    if case .hang(let hang) = report.result {
        uploadHangDiagnostic(duration: hang.hangDuration,
                             callStack: hang.callStackTree)
    }
}
```

`report.environment` includes the signpost intervals and reported app states active around the hang — see `axiom-performance (skills/metrickit-ref.md)` Part 1.

On earlier releases, adopt the legacy subscriber:

```swift
import MetricKit

class MetricsSubscriber: NSObject, MXMetricManagerSubscriber {
    func didReceive(_ payloads: [MXDiagnosticPayload]) {
        for payload in payloads {
            if let hangDiagnostics = payload.hangDiagnostics {
                for diagnostic in hangDiagnostics {
                    analyzeHang(diagnostic)
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private func analyzeHang(_ diagnostic: MXHangDiagnostic) {
        // Duration of the hang
        let duration = diagnostic.hangDuration

        // Call stack tree (needs symbolication)
        let callStack = diagnostic.callStackTree

        // Send to your analytics
        uploadHangDiagnostic(duration: duration, callStack: callStack)
    }
}
```

**Key MXHangDiagnostic properties**:
- `hangDuration`: How long the hang lasted
- `callStackTree`: MXCallStackTree with frames

There is no built-in grouping identifier — derive your own signature from the symbolicated call stack to group similar hangs.

## Watchdog Terminations

The watchdog kills apps that hang during key transitions:

| Transition | Time Limit | Consequence |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| **App launch** | ~20 seconds | App killed, crash logged |
| **Background transition** | ~5 seconds | App killed |
| **Foreground transition** | ~10 seconds | App killed |

**Watchdog disabled in**:
- Simulator
- Debugger attached
- Development builds (sometimes)

**Watchdog kills are logged as crashes** with exception type `EXC_CRASH (SIGKILL)` and termination reason code `0x8badf00d` ("ate bad food"), namespace `SPRINGBOARD` (or `FRONTBOARD`). Don't confuse it with `Namespace RUNNINGBOARD, Code 0xDEAD10CC` — that is a different termination (the app held a file or SQLite lock while being suspended), not a watchdog timeout.

**A hang with no watchdog kill is normal.** Enforcement centers on launch (`scene-create`) and lifecycle transitions; mid-session responsiveness monitoring (`scene-update`) is not guaranteed to fire for every frozen app. Treat a missing watchdog report as no signal — not as evidence the app isn't hanging.

## Getting Hang Data from End Users

A hang raises no signal or exception, so crash SDKs (Bugsnag, Sentry, Crashlytics) report nothing unless their separate app-hang detection is enabled. Two capture paths need no developer tools on the user's device:

### sysdiagnose stackshot — must be captured DURING the hang

sysdiagnose includes a stackshot (`stacks-*.ips`): per-thread backtraces of every running process at the moment of capture — the iOS equivalent of Android's `bugreport` thread dump. It is a snapshot: it only shows the hang if triggered while the app is frozen.

1. While the app is hung — press both volume buttons + the side button together briefly; a short vibration confirms capture started
2. Wait for the archive to be written (up to ~10 minutes)
3. Retrieve: Settings > Privacy & Security > Analytics & Improvements > Analytics Data > `sysdiagnose_….tar.gz` — share via AirDrop
4. Stackshot frames are unsymbolicated (program-counter offsets) — symbolicate against the app and framework dSYMs

A sysdiagnose captured after the app recovers or relaunches shows nothing useful about the hang — the most common reason "sysdiagnose has no stacks for my process".

### Analytics Data .ips reports

The same Settings > Analytics Data list holds `.ips` reports users can share directly: crashes, watchdog kills (`0x8badf00d`), and hang reports. An empty list is no signal (see Watchdog Terminations above).

**Prefer MetricKit for ongoing capture** — MXHangDiagnostic needs no user action at all; see the MetricKit section above and `axiom-performance (skills/metrickit-ref.md)`.

## Pressure Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Manager Says "Just Add a Loading Spinner"

**Situation**: App hangs during data load. Manager suggests adding spinner to "fix" it.

**Why this fails**: Adding a spinner doesn't prevent the hang—the UI still freezes, the spinner won't animate, and the app remains unresponsive.

**Correct response**: "A spinner won't animate during a hang because the main thread is blocked. We need to move this work off the main thread so the spinner can actually spin and the app stays responsive."

### Scenario 2: "It Works Fine in Testing"

**Situation**: QA can't reproduce the hang. Logs show it happens in production.

**Analysis**:
1. Field devices have different data sizes
2. Network conditions vary (slow connection = longer sync)
3. Background apps consume memory/CPU
4. Watchdog is disabled in debug builds

**Action**:
- Add MetricKit to capture field diagnostics
- Test with production-sized datasets
- Test without debugger attached
- Check Organizer for hang reports

### Scenario 3: "We've Always Done It This Way"

**Situation**: Legacy code calls synchronous API on main thread. Refactoring is "too risky."

**Why it matters**: Even if it worked before:
- Data may have grown larger
- OS updates may have changed timing
- New devices have different characteristics
- Users notice more as apps get faster

**Approach**:
1. Add metrics to measure current hang rate
2. Refactor incrementally with feature flags
3. A/B test to show improvement
4. Document risk of not fixing

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Wrong | Instead |
|--------------|----------------|---------|
| `DispatchQueue.main.sync` from background | Can deadlock, always blocks | Use `.async` |
| Semaphore to convert async to sync | Blocks calling thread | Stay async with completion/await |
| File I/O on main thread | Unpredictable latency | Background queue |
| Unfiltered notification observer | Processes irrelevant events | Filter by object/name |
| Creating formatters in loops | Expensive initialization | Cache and reuse |
| Synchronous network request | Blocks on network latency | URLSession async |
