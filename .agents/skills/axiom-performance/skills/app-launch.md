# App Launch Performance

Diagnose and fix slow app launch — from the moment the user taps the icon to the moment the first frame is interactive. The target Apple sets is **first frame within ~400 ms**, app interactive by the time the launch animation finishes. iOS runs a watchdog that *terminates* apps that overrun the launch budget.

This skill owns the launch-specific workflow. It cross-links — does not duplicate — Instruments/signpost mechanics (`performance-profiling`, `xctrace-ref`), `MXAppLaunchMetric` field data (`metrickit-ref`), and main-thread analysis (`hang-diagnostics`).

## Red Flags — Check This Skill When

| Symptom | This skill applies |
|---|---|
| App takes >1 s (new device) or >2 s (old device) to show its first screen | Yes |
| Launch is fine on your phone, slow on users' older phones | Yes — measure on the oldest supported device |
| First screen appears but is frozen for a moment before it responds | Yes — Phase 3 / extended launch |
| Xcode Organizer "Launches" pane flags a regression | Yes |
| App is slow to come up after tapping a push notification | Yes — notification-launch path |
| App is slow only when returning from the background (app switcher) | No — that's a *resume*, not a launch. Don't measure it as one. |
| App is responsive but generally sluggish during use | No → `performance-profiling` |
| UI is completely frozen mid-session | No → `hang-diagnostics` |

## Launch vs Resume — Get the Vocabulary Right

| Type | When | Cost | Reproduce |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cold launch** | After reboot, or after the system evicted the app from memory | Highest, most variable | Restart device, wait ~30 s for boot work to settle, then launch |
| **Warm launch** | App relaunched soon after being force-quit; frameworks still cached in memory | Lower, more consistent — Apple recommends measuring this | Force-quit (swipe up in app switcher), wait ~5 s, launch |
| **Hot launch / resume** | User re-enters from app switcher or Home Screen; process still alive | Near-instant | Background the app, immediately return — **this is not a launch; never measure it as one** |
| **Notification launch** | User taps a push notification; a launch carrying a deep-link/action payload | Cold or warm + payload resolution | Background, send a push (`xcrun simctl push` or server), tap it |

## The Launch Phase Model

```dot
digraph launch {
  rankdir=LR;
  "icon tap" [shape=ellipse];
  "Phase 1\npre-main" [shape=box];
  "Phase 2\nmain → first frame" [shape=box];
  "Phase 3\nfirst frame → interactive" [shape=box];
  "icon tap" -> "Phase 1\npre-main" -> "Phase 2\nmain → first frame" -> "Phase 3\nfirst frame → interactive";
}
```

In Instruments these map to the **App Life Cycle timeline**: process initialization → UIKit initialization → UIKit initial scene rendering → initial frame rendering, plus the app-owned "extended" tail.

### Phase 1 — Pre-main (before your `main()` runs)

The dynamic loader (`dyld`) maps the executable, loads every linked framework/dylib, and resolves symbols. Then the runtime runs static initializers. Roughly 100 ms of fixed system work *plus* whatever your dependencies add.

What costs time here:
- **Number of dynamically-linked frameworks.** Each one adds dyld work. Built-in system frameworks (CoreFoundation, etc.) are nearly free (shared memory across processes); third-party embedded frameworks are not.
- **Static initializers that run before `main()`:** C++ static constructors, Objective-C `+load` methods, `__attribute__((constructor))` functions, and entries in `__DATA,__mod_init_func`.
- **Forced eager evaluation in Swift.** Swift global `let`/`var` and stored type properties are computed *lazily* on first access — they do **not** run pre-main. Pre-main Swift cost shows up only via Obj-C-interop `+load`, C/C++ constructors, or code you force to run eagerly.
- `dlopen` / `NSBundle.load` at launch — forfeits the dyld launch-closure win.

Measure it with the **`dyld Activity`** instrument (static-initializer timings) or the App Launch template's pre-main lanes.

### Phase 2 — main → first frame

System creates `UIApplication` and your delegate, then your code runs:
- UIKit (no scenes): `application(_:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` → `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` → create root view controllers here.
- UIKit (UIScene): `willFinish`/`didFinishLaunching` still fire, but **create root view controllers in `scene(_:willConnectTo:options:)`**, not in `didFinishLaunching`. Doing both is a common bug.
- SwiftUI: `App.init()` then `App.body` (`Scene`/root `View`). Heavy work in either blocks the first frame.
- Then layout + draw of the first frame's view hierarchy.

The launch cycle does not complete until your delegate methods *return*. Anything synchronous and slow here — disk I/O, network, decoding, big data loads — is straight-up launch time.

### Phase 3 — first frame → interactive (extended launch)

The launch metric stops at the first frame, but the user's experience doesn't. If your first frame has placeholders for async data, the app must already be interactive — and you should *measure* the extended tail yourself with signposts (and optionally `MXMetricManager.extendLaunchMeasurement(forTaskID:)` for field data).

## Decision Path

```dot
digraph decide {
  "Slow launch?" [shape=diamond];
  "Reproducible & clean?" [shape=diamond];
  "Profile: App Launch template" [shape=box];
  "Which phase dominates?" [shape=diamond];
  "Fix Phase 1\n(dyld / static init)" [shape=box];
  "Fix Phase 2\n(main → first frame)" [shape=box];
  "Fix Phase 3\n(extended launch)" [shape=box];
  "Lock down environment\n(reboot, release build,\nairplane mode, stable data,\noldest device)" [shape=box];

  "Slow launch?" -> "Reproducible & clean?";
  "Reproducible & clean?" -> "Lock down environment\n(reboot, release build,\nairplane mode, stable data,\noldest device)" [label="no"];
  "Lock down environment\n(reboot, release build,\nairplane mode, stable data,\noldest device)" -> "Profile: App Launch template";
  "Reproducible & clean?" -> "Profile: App Launch template" [label="yes"];
  "Profile: App Launch template" -> "Which phase dominates?";
  "Which phase dominates?" -> "Fix Phase 1\n(dyld / static init)" [label="pre-main"];
  "Which phase dominates?" -> "Fix Phase 2\n(main → first frame)" [label="didFinishLaunching /\nApp.init / root view"];
  "Which phase dominates?" -> "Fix Phase 3\n(extended launch)" [label="first frame → interactive"];
}
```

## Triage Without Instruments (deadline mode)

You do **not** need an Instruments session to start — a code-review pass of the launch path is a legitimate first move, and there's a zero-setup pre-main breakdown:

- **`DYLD_PRINT_STATISTICS=1`** (Xcode → Edit Scheme → Run → Arguments → Environment Variables) prints Phase-1 timings to the console at launch — total pre-main time, dylib loading, rebase/bind, ObjC setup, initializers — with no Instruments needed. If pre-main is small (~100–200 ms), the problem is your code (Phase 2/3) — go to the next bullet. If it's large, the cause is framework count and/or `+load` work — that's usually *not* a safe same-night fix (file it for the next release) so pivot to Phase 2 anyway for the quick win.
- **Read the launch path directly:** `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` / `scene(_:willConnectTo:options:)` / `App.init()` / `App.body` / root `viewDidLoad` / first `View.body`. Walk the "Fixes by Phase → Phase 2" list below as a checklist — analytics/SDK init, synchronous network, `SELECT *` at launch, `ModelContainer`/`@Query` setup, heavy view hierarchy, priority inversions.
- **Bisect on a real device:** comment out SDK initializers one at a time, watch `DYLD_PRINT_STATISTICS` + the launch console log.
- **Verify the win** with the `XCTApplicationLaunchMetric` test (below), ideally on a real device — minutes, not an Instruments session.

Do the full Instruments + hygiene pass when you have time; this is the under-deadline path, not a replacement.

## Measurement Hygiene (do this before profiling)

Field devices are noisy; an unstable baseline tells you nothing. Before you measure:
- **Reboot the device** and wait a few minutes for boot-time work to settle.
- **Use a Release build** (Profile scheme) — debug overhead and missing optimizations distort everything.
- **Cut network variance** — airplane mode, or mock network dependencies in code.
- **Stabilize iCloud** — use an unchanging account/data, or sign out.
- **Use fixed mock data sets** — ideally one small and one large; load only what the first screen needs.
- **Pick a device set and stick to it** — include your oldest supported device; performance characteristics differ wildly from the newest.
- **Measure warm launches** for consistency; measure cold launches separately when that's the case you care about.
- **Profiling ≠ measuring.** Instruments adds overhead (a 6 ms phase can show 149 ms under the profiler). Profile to *find* the work; use `XCTApplicationLaunchMetric` to *measure* the real number.

## Tools

| Tool | Use it for | Cross-link |
|---|---|---|
| Instruments **App Launch** template | The triage workhorse — time profile + thread-state trace, broken into launch phases. Configure target, hit record, read which phase dominates and which thread is blocked. "Extended Launch" captures the full flow. | `performance-profiling` |
| Instruments **dyld Activity** | Static-initializer timings, dyld closure cost | `performance-profiling` |
| `xctrace record --template 'App Launch' --launch -- <app>` | Headless / CI launch profiling | `xctrace-ref` |
| Xcode Organizer — **Launch Time** pane | Field ms (50th/90th pct) by device & OS, version-over-version | — |
| Xcode Organizer — **Launches** pane | Longest functions during startup, with stack traces and a 14-day trend | — |
| `XCTApplicationLaunchMetric` (XCTest) | Regression gate in CI — see snippet below | `axiom-testing` |
| `MXAppLaunchMetric` (MetricKit) | Field histograms: `histogrammedTimeToFirstDraw`, `histogrammedOptimizedTimeToFirstDraw` (prewarmed), `histogrammedApplicationResumeTime`, `histogrammedExtendedLaunch`; `MXDiagnosticPayload.appLaunchDiagnostics` for slow-launch stacks | `metrickit-ref` |
| MetricKit 27 launch family `OS27` | Typed field metrics `.timeToFirstDraw` / `.optimizedTimeToFirstDraw` / `.applicationResumeTime` / `.extendedLaunch`, the `.appLaunch` diagnostic with launch stacks, and `MetricManager.trackLaunchTask(id:)` to instrument named extended-launch work (`@MainActor`, sync/async overloads) | `metrickit-ref` Part 1 |
| App Store Connect — "App Extended Launch Usage" report | Field extended-launch data (iOS 17.4+, daily) | — |
| Custom **Points of Interest** signpost | Marking your own "app is interactive" boundary | `performance-profiling` |

### Custom "app is interactive" signpost

When your real interactive point is *after* the first frame (async data, document open), bracket it with a signpost so it shows up in the Points of Interest instrument.

Swift:
```swift
import OSLog
let launchLog = OSSignposter(subsystem: "com.example.app", category: .pointsOfInterest)

// at the start of launch-critical setup
let state = launchLog.beginInterval("Launch → interactive")
// ... later, once the screen is genuinely usable
launchLog.endInterval("Launch → interactive", state)
```

Objective-C uses `os_signpost(OS_SIGNPOST_INTERVAL_BEGIN/END, log, "Launch → interactive")` with an `OSLog` created with the `OS_LOG_CATEGORY_POINTS_OF_INTEREST` category. In SwiftUI, begin in `App.init()` (or a root-view `task`) and end from the first view's `.onAppear` once data has loaded.

### Regression test (XCTest)

```swift
func testLaunchPerformance() {
    measure(metrics: [XCTApplicationLaunchMetric()]) {
        XCUIApplication().launch()
    }
}
```

One throwaway launch, then (by default) five measured iterations with statistics. `XCTApplicationLaunchMetric(waitUntilResponsive:)` extends the window to first-responsive. (`XCTApplicationLaunchMetric` supersedes the old `XCTOSSignpostMetric.applicationLaunch`.) For field monitoring, wrap your extended-launch tasks in `MXMetricManager.shared.extendLaunchMeasurement(forTaskID:)` / `finishExtendedLaunchMeasurement(forTaskID:)`.

## Fixes by Phase

### Phase 1 — Pre-main

- **Reduce dynamic framework count.** Consolidate small frameworks; change linkage where you can — see the strategy table below.
- **Move `+load` work to `+initialize`** (lazy, first message) or to an explicit init API you call after launch.
- **Don't force Swift globals/type properties eager.** Let them stay lazy. If a framework you own does heavy module-load work, expose an init-early API instead.
- **No `dlopen`/`NSBundle.load` on the launch path.**

#### Linkage strategy — static vs dynamic vs mergeable

Apple publishes **no numeric threshold** here — only that "each additional third-party framework that your app loads adds to the launch time", and that built-in frameworks "have a much lower impact on launch, because they use shared memory with other processes that use the same framework". Note dyld "caches a lot of this work in a launch closure when the user installs the app", so per-library cost is not paid in full on every launch. Measure with `DYLD_PRINT_STATISTICS=1` before deciding.

| Linkage | Launch cost | Choose it when |
|---|---|---|
| Static (`.a`, static framework) | None at load — code is in the app binary at build time, and unreferenced code can be dead-stripped | The module is used by one binary and doesn't need to be shared |
| Dynamic (embedded `.framework`/`.dylib`) | dyld load + symbol resolution per library, partly amortized by the launch closure | Genuinely shared between app and extensions, or loaded conditionally |
| **Mergeable** (Xcode 15+) | Static-like in optimized builds, dynamic in unoptimized ones | You want many small modules for build times without paying for them at launch — the default answer for first-party modules |

**Static linking is not free.** A static library is copied into *every* binary that links it: link it into both the app and three extensions and you ship four copies, and any global state in it is four separate copies too. When two dynamic frameworks each statically link the same library, both copies load into one process — this does *not* fail at link time; it surfaces at runtime as duplicated global state and the Obj-C runtime's "Class X is implemented in both …, one of the two will be used" warning, with a nondeterministic winner. Static libraries containing Obj-C categories need `-ObjC` in Other Linker Flags or the categories vanish — which force-loads every class and category from those libraries, giving back much of the dead-stripping benefit above.

**Mergeable libraries**, in Apple's words, get "app launch times similar to static linking in release builds, without losing dynamically linked build times in debug builds". Configure two settings:

| Setting | Goes on | Value | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MERGED_BINARY_TYPE` ("Create Merged Binary") | the *merging* target — only executables, dynamic libraries, and frameworks qualify | `automatic` | Every direct dependency that builds a dynamic library/framework is built mergeable and merged into this binary in optimized builds, reexported in unoptimized ones |
| `MERGED_BINARY_TYPE` | the merging target | `manual` | Only dependencies that opt in via `MERGEABLE_LIBRARY` are merged |
| `MERGEABLE_LIBRARY` ("Build Mergeable Library") | each *dependency* target you build | `YES` | Links mergeable in optimized builds, normal-dynamic-to-be-reexported otherwise. **No effect on static libraries** — it applies to dynamic libraries and frameworks only |

A **direct dependency** meets *both* of Apple's criteria: it is listed in the target's Link Binary with Libraries phase, **and** it is the product of another target in your project. Anything else — a pre-built library, or a dependency's own dependencies — is indirect. Under the hood merging is the linker's `-make_mergeable` (`-merge_framework`/`-merge-l` when merging, `-reexport_framework`/`-reexport-l` when not); you should not need to set these by hand.

For a large dependency graph, Apple's recommended structure is a **group library**: an intermediate framework target with `MERGED_BINARY_TYPE = automatic` that the mergeable libraries hang off, with the app depending only on that one target.

Mergeable-library gotchas:

| Gotcha | Consequence |
|---|---|
| `automatic` covers **direct** dependencies only | Xcode does not build *indirect* dependencies — a dependency's own dependencies — as mergeable. `MERGEABLE_LIBRARY` only helps for dependency targets in your project; you cannot set it on someone else's binary |
| Pre-built XCFrameworks | Merge under `automatic` *or* `manual` if the vendor already shipped `MergeableMetadata`, and not at all if they didn't. Mergeability is baked in at vendor build time, not chosen by you |
| Merging is keyed on **optimization, not configuration name** | Apple defines a debug build as unoptimized (`-O0`/`-Onone`, flagged by `IS_UNOPTIMIZED_BUILD`). A config *named* Release that still sets `-Onone` will not merge; a custom optimized "Profile" config will. Verify against an actually-optimized build |
| Dependency shared by app *and* an extension | Merging puts a copy in each binary. Apple explicitly flags this — keep it dynamic if extension binary size matters more than the app's launch |
| `SKIP_MERGEABLE_LIBRARY_BUNDLE_HOOK = YES` | Removes the hook that keeps the library's resource bundle findable, so `Bundle(for:)` stops returning it. Leave it off if you look up resources that way |
| Mergeable XCFrameworks (`MergeableMetadata`) | Require Xcode 15+; older Xcode fails the build outright |
| Debug and release layouts differ | In unoptimized builds Xcode copies dependency binaries into a location inside the merged product and adds an extra `@rpath` for them — expect the product structure to change between configurations |

**When not to bother.** Pre-main carries a floor of system work you cannot remove. If `DYLD_PRINT_STATISTICS` shows dyld is a small slice of your launch, relinking the whole project buys you nothing — the time is in Phase 2. Restructure linkage only when pre-main is measurably the dominant phase.

### Phase 2 — main → first frame

- **Defer everything not needed for the first frame** out of `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` / `scene(_:willConnectTo:)` / `App.init` / `App.body` / root `viewDidLoad` / first `View.body`: analytics SDK init, network sync (→ background queue or `BGTask`), non-view services (persistence, location) → init on first use.
- **Load only first-screen data.** A table view shows ~10–20 cells; load those synchronously, fetch the rest in the background and update when done. Don't `SELECT *` at launch.
- **Watch SwiftData/Core Data stack cost.** Building a `ModelContainer` (or a Core Data stack) in `App.init()` and a `@Query` / `FetchRequest` on the root view both run on the launch path — keep store setup off the critical path where you can (migrations especially), scope `@Query` predicates/`fetchLimit` to what the first screen shows, and load the rest after first frame.
- **Get GCD priorities right.** A user-interactive main thread waiting on a background-QoS queue is a priority inversion — it stalls launch. Use the correct concurrency primitive so priority propagates; offload heavy main-actor work (cross-link `axiom-concurrency`).
- **Simplify the first view hierarchy** — flatten views, fewer Auto Layout constraints, lazily load views not visible at launch, avoid unnecessary custom `draw(_:)`.

### Phase 3 — first frame → interactive

- **Placeholders + async load** — render a usable frame immediately, fill in data asynchronously, keep the UI responsive throughout.
- **Signpost the extended phase** so you can see where the tail goes.
- **No speculative pre-warming.** Pre-building screens the user hasn't navigated to (e.g. a detail VC inside `cellForRowAt`) is a classic launch regression — measure before assuming a "pre-warm" helps.

## Push-Notification Launch

A notification tap is a launch entry path that arrives with a deep-link/action payload. Targets: **tap → first pixel ≈ 200 ms**, **tap → interactive content ≈ 1 s**.

- **Don't do heavy work in `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` handlers** (`didReceive`) — they run on the launch path. Resolve the deep link to a route, then render; defer network/database fetches until after the first pixel.
- **Cache deep-link routing data** so resolving a payload to a destination is cheap.
- **Background-app-refresh pre-warming is opportunistic, not guaranteed** — design the tap path to be fast from a cold state; treat any pre-warmed state as a bonus.
- **Profile it on a real device** with the App Launch template ("Extended Launch") plus a custom signpost around the notification-handling flow; simulator timing isn't representative. Send a test push with `xcrun simctl push`.
- Handler-side detail (categories, actions, content extensions) → cross-link `axiom-integration` (push notifications).

## Common Launch Mistakes

| Mistake | Why it bites | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Measuring in the Simulator / a Debug build | Numbers are meaningless — different perf characteristics, debug overhead | Release build, real device, oldest supported model |
| Measuring a resume and calling it a launch | Resumes are ~free; you'll think launch is fine when it isn't | Force-quit (or reboot) before each measurement |
| Synchronous I/O or network in `didFinishLaunching` / `App.init` | The launch cycle blocks until those return | Background queue; load on first use |
| Loading all data at launch | Scales with the user's data, not the screen | Load the first screen's data only; lazy-load the rest |
| Heavy `+load` / many embedded dynamic frameworks | Runs before `main()`, before you can do anything | `+initialize`/runtime init; consolidate/merge frameworks |
| Speculative pre-warming of unseen screens | Adds guaranteed cost for a maybe-benefit | Measure first; usually just delete it |
| Big allocations during launch | Raises memory pressure → watchdog-termination risk | Allocate lazily; stream large data |
| "Profiled it, it's 400 ms" | Profiler overhead inflates numbers | Profile to find work; `XCTApplicationLaunchMetric` to measure |

## Quick Reference — Commands

```bash
# Headless launch profile
xctrace record --template 'App Launch' --launch -- /path/to/Your.app

# Clean-boot a dedicated simulator for consistent dev-time measurement (real device for real numbers);
# erase deletes every app and its data on that device
# `;` not `&&`: shutdown exits non-zero on an already-shut-down device; erase still refuses a booted one
xcrun simctl shutdown <device-udid>; xcrun simctl erase <device-udid> && xcrun simctl boot <device-udid>

# Send a test push to a booted simulator (notification-launch testing)
xcrun simctl push <device-udid> com.example.app payload.apns
# payload.apns: {"aps":{"alert":"Test","sound":"default"}, "deep_link":"app://detail/42"}

# Run the launch regression test
xcodebuild test -scheme MyApp -destination 'platform=iOS,name=...' -only-testing:MyAppPerfTests/LaunchPerfTests
```

In Instruments: File → New → choose **App Launch** template → select your app as the target → Record. Triple-click a phase band to see its stack traces; gray thread = blocked, red = runnable-but-starved, orange = preempted, blue = running.
