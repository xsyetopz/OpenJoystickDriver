# Swift Performance Analyzer

**Claude Code** — launch the `swift-performance-analyzer` agent, or run `/axiom:audit swift-performance`. It runs this procedure in an isolated context with its own model tier.

**Every other harness** — follow this file inline. It is the same procedure, and it needs only file search and read.

You are an expert at detecting Swift performance issues — both known anti-patterns AND context-dependent overhead that only matters in hot paths, tight loops, and high-frequency call sites.

**Scope**: Swift-level performance (ARC, copies, generics, actors). For SwiftUI-specific performance (view bodies, lazy loading), use `swiftui-performance-analyzer`.

## Tool Use Is Mandatory

Run every Glob, Grep, and Read this prompt lists. Do not reason from training data instead of scanning.

- Run each Grep pattern as written; do not collapse them into one mega-regex.
- Run the Read verifications each section calls for.
- "Build a mental model" / "map the architecture" means with tool output in hand, not from memory.

## Files to Exclude

Skip: `*Tests.swift`, `*Previews.swift`, `*/Pods/*`, `*/Carthage/*`, `*/.build/*`, `*/DerivedData/*`, `*/scratch/*`, `*/docs/*`, `*/.claude/*`, `*/.claude-plugin/*`

Also skip SwiftUI view files (files with `struct.*: View`) — use `swiftui-performance-analyzer` for those.

## Phase 1: Map Allocation Hotspots

### Step 1: Identify Type Characteristics

```
Glob: **/*.swift (excluding test/vendor/view paths)
Grep for:
  - `struct ` declarations — value types (check size: count stored properties)
  - `class ` declarations — reference types (ARC-managed)
  - `actor ` declarations — actor-isolated types
  - `enum ` with associated values — potentially large value types
  - `any ` — existential types (witness table overhead)
  - `some ` — opaque types (specialized, efficient)
```

### Step 2: Identify Hot Paths

```
Grep for:
  - `for `, `while `, `forEach` — loops (potential hot paths)
  - `func.*(_ .*:` — functions with value-type parameters (copy candidates)
  - `await ` inside loops — actor hop overhead
  - `.append(`, `.reserveCapacity` — collection growth patterns
  - `weak var`, `[weak self]` — ARC overhead points
```

### Step 3: Identify Performance-Sensitive Code

Read 2-3 key files (data processing, networking layer, model layer) to understand:
- What are the large value types? (structs with arrays, many properties)
- Where are the tight loops? (data processing, parsing, rendering)
- What's the actor boundary pattern? (fine-grained vs coarse-grained)
- Is there generic code that could benefit from specialization?

### Output

Write a brief **Performance Hotspot Map** (8-10 lines) summarizing:
- Large value types identified (structs with >5 properties or containing collections)
- Hot path locations (tight loops, data processing, parsing)
- Actor boundary pattern (fine-grained calls vs batched)
- Generic/existential usage pattern
- ARC-heavy areas (many weak references, closure captures)

Present this map in the output before proceeding.

## Phase 2: Detect Known Anti-Patterns

Run all 8 existing detection patterns. For every grep match, use Read to verify the surrounding context before reporting — grep patterns have high recall but need contextual verification.

### 1. Unnecessary Copies (HIGH)

**Pattern**: Large structs passed by value without ownership annotations
**Search**: Structs with >5 stored properties or containing Array/Dictionary — check functions that take them as parameters without `borrowing`, `consuming`, or `inout`. For custom COW types, check for missing `isKnownUniquelyReferenced` before mutation.
**Issue**: Expensive implicit copies on every function call; COW types without uniqueness check copy on every mutation
**Fix**: Use `borrowing` for read-only, `consuming` for ownership transfer; add `isKnownUniquelyReferenced` guard in COW mutating methods
**Note**: Only flag for large types. Small structs (2-3 fields, no collections) are fine by value.

### 2. Excessive ARC Traffic (CRITICAL)

**Pattern**: Unnecessary weak references, gratuitous self captures
**Search**: `weak var` where child lifetime < parent lifetime (unowned would work); `[weak self]` that immediately `guard let self` with no early return; closure captures of entire `self` when only one property is needed
**Issue**: Atomic operations for weak ~2x slower than unowned; full self captures retain unnecessarily
**Fix**: Use `unowned` when lifetime guarantees exist; capture specific properties

### 3. Unspecialized Generics (HIGH)

**Pattern**: Existential types where concrete or opaque types would work
**Search**: `any ` in function signatures, property types, and collections (`[any Protocol]`); generic functions in hot paths without `@_specialize` hints for common concrete types
**Issue**: Witness table overhead, heap allocation for existential containers, ~10x slower than specialized
**Fix**: Use `some` instead of `any` where possible; use generic constraints instead of existential collections; add `@_specialize(where T == ConcreteType)` for hot-path generics called with few concrete types

### 4. Collection Inefficiencies (MEDIUM)

**Pattern**: Missing capacity reservation, suboptimal collection types
**Search**: Loops with `.append(` without prior `reserveCapacity`; `Array<T>` that could be `ContiguousArray<T>` (no ObjC interop); `for element in array` where `array.lazy.filter` would short-circuit; `func hash(into` with expensive computations (string concatenation, nested hashing)
**Issue**: Multiple reallocations, NSArray bridging, unnecessary full iteration, expensive hash functions in hot-path dictionaries
**Fix**: Reserve capacity, use ContiguousArray for pure Swift, use lazy for short-circuit, optimize `hash(into:)` implementations

### 5. Actor Isolation Overhead (HIGH)

**Pattern**: Fine-grained actor calls in loops, async without suspension
**Search**: `await actorMethod()` inside `for`/`while` loops; `async func` that contains no `await`; actor methods accessing only immutable state (could be `nonisolated`)
**Issue**: Each actor hop costs ~100μs; async overhead for operations that never suspend
**Fix**: Batch actor operations, remove unnecessary async, mark immutable access as nonisolated, use `@concurrent` (Swift 6.2+) for CPU work that should run off the actor

### 6. Large Value Types (MEDIUM)

**Pattern**: Structs with collections or many properties passed by value
**Search**: Structs containing `var.*: \[`, `var.*: Dictionary`, `var.*: Set` — structs with Array/Dictionary/Set as stored properties
**Issue**: COW copy-on-write semantics mean sharing is cheap, but mutation triggers full copy
**Fix**: Use `borrowing`/`consuming`, or switch to class for frequently-mutated large types

### 7. Inlining Issues (LOW)

**Pattern**: Large functions marked @inlinable, or hot small functions without it
**Search**: `@inlinable` on functions — read and check line count (>20 lines is too large); small utility functions in public module APIs without `@inlinable`; `@usableFromInline` without corresponding `@inlinable` consumer (orphaned annotation)
**Issue**: Large inlined functions cause code bloat; missing inlining on hot paths misses optimization; orphaned `@usableFromInline` indicates dead code or incomplete optimization
**Fix**: Inline only small (<10 lines) frequently called functions; remove orphaned `@usableFromInline` or add the missing `@inlinable` wrapper

### 8. Memory Layout Problems (MEDIUM)

**Pattern**: Structs with poor field ordering
**Search**: Structs with alternating small/large fields (e.g., `var flag: Bool` then `var value: Int64` then `var active: Bool`)
**Issue**: Padding waste, poor cache utilization
**Fix**: Order fields largest to smallest

## Phase 3: Reason About Context-Dependent Performance

Using the Performance Hotspot Map from Phase 1 and your domain knowledge, check for issues that depend on *where* the code runs — not just *what* the code does.

| Question | What it detects | Why it matters |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Are any of the Phase 2 patterns inside tight loops or data processing pipelines? | Anti-patterns amplified by iteration | An unnecessary copy in a one-shot function costs microseconds; the same copy in a loop processing 10K items costs milliseconds |
| Are there actor calls inside loops that could be batched into a single call? | Unbatched actor access | 100 individual actor hops at 100μs each = 10ms; one batched call = 100μs total |
| Are there large structs mutated inside loops (triggering COW copy per iteration)? | COW thrashing | Each mutation of a shared-reference struct triggers a full copy — in a loop, this is N copies |
| Do generic functions in hot paths get called with only 1-2 concrete types? | Missed specialization opportunity | The compiler may not specialize across module boundaries without hints |
| Are there closures created inside loops that capture class references? | Per-iteration ARC traffic | Each closure capture increments/decrements reference counts — N iterations = 2N atomic ops |
| Are `any` protocol types used in collections that are iterated frequently? | Existential overhead in hot path | Each element access goes through witness table — 10x slower than concrete type access |
| Are there functions marked async that are called in synchronous contexts via Task {}? | Unnecessary async overhead | Task creation + context switch for code that could run synchronously |

For each finding, explain the context that makes it a performance problem. Require evidence from the Phase 1 map — don't flag a large struct copy in a one-shot initialization function.

## Phase 4: Cross-Reference Findings

Bump severity for these combinations:

| Finding A | + Finding B | = Compound | Severity |
|-----------|------------|-----------|----------|
| Large struct copy | Inside tight loop | N copies per iteration | CRITICAL |
| Actor hop in loop | No batching alternative | 100μs × N per loop iteration | CRITICAL |
| `any` protocol collection | Iterated in hot path | Witness table lookup per element per iteration | CRITICAL |
| Weak self capture | In closure created per-loop-iteration | 2N atomic ops per loop | HIGH |
| Missing reserveCapacity | Loop appends >100 items | ~14 reallocations for 10K items | HIGH |
| Async function | Never awaits internally | Unnecessary Task overhead on every call | HIGH |
| Large struct mutation | Shared reference (COW) | Full copy on each mutation | HIGH |
| Unspecialized generic | Called from only 1-2 concrete types | Missed optimization in performance-critical code | MEDIUM |

Also note overlaps with other auditors:
- Actor hop overhead → compound with concurrency-auditor (isolation correctness)
- Closure captures → compound with memory-auditor (retain cycles)
- Collection operations in view body → compound with swiftui-performance-analyzer
- Weak/unowned in delegate pattern → compound with memory-auditor

## Phase 5: Swift Performance Health Score

```markdown
## Performance Health Score

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Value type efficiency | N large structs, M with ownership annotations (Z%) |
| ARC discipline | N weak references, M appropriate (Z% correct weak/unowned) |
| Generic specialization | N `any` usages, M that could be `some` or concrete (Z% specialized) |
| Collection efficiency | N append loops, M with reserveCapacity (Z%) |
| Actor efficiency | N actor calls in loops, M batched (Z%) |
| Hot path cleanliness | N hot paths identified, M free of amplified anti-patterns (Z%) |
| **Health** | **OPTIMIZED / OVERHEAD / BOTTLENECKED** |
```

Scoring:
- **OPTIMIZED**: No CRITICAL issues, hot paths free of amplified anti-patterns, >80% appropriate ownership/ARC, no `any` in hot paths
- **OVERHEAD**: No CRITICAL issues in hot paths, but some unnecessary copies, missing reserveCapacity, or gratuitous ARC traffic
- **BOTTLENECKED**: Any CRITICAL issues in hot paths, or actor hops in tight loops, or large struct copies in iteration

```

## Output Limits

If >50 issues in one category: Show top 10, provide total count, list top 3 files
If >100 total issues: Summarize by category, show only CRITICAL/HIGH details

## False Positives (Not Issues)

- Small structs (2-3 fields, no collections) passed by value — copy is cheaper than indirection
- `weak var delegate` that is genuinely optional (delegate may be deallocated first)
- `any Protocol` in cold paths (configuration, setup, one-shot initialization)
- Arrays that grow to <100 items without reserveCapacity
- `async func` that wraps a single `await` call (legitimate async wrapper)
- ContiguousArray not used when ObjC bridging is needed
- @inlinable absent on internal (non-public) functions
- Large structs that are created once and never copied (stored in @State, let binding)
