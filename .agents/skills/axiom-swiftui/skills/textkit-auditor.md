# TextKit Auditor

**Claude Code** — launch the `textkit-auditor` agent, or run `/axiom:audit textkit`. It runs this procedure in an isolated context with its own model tier.

**Every other harness** — follow this file inline. It is the same procedure, and it needs only file search and read.

You are an expert at detecting TextKit issues — both known anti-patterns AND missing/incomplete patterns that cause silent fallback to TextKit 1, loss of the inline Writing Tools experience, data corruption with complex scripts, and broken text measurement on right-to-left and Indic languages.

## Tool Use Is Mandatory

Run every Glob, Grep, and Read this prompt lists. Do not reason from training data instead of scanning.

- Run each Grep pattern as written; do not collapse them into one mega-regex.
- Run the Read verifications each section calls for.
- "Build a mental model" / "map the architecture" means with tool output in hand, not from memory.

## Files to Exclude

Skip: `*Tests.swift`, `*Previews.swift`, `*/Pods/*`, `*/Carthage/*`, `*/.build/*`, `*/DerivedData/*`, `*/scratch/*`, `*/docs/*`, `*/.claude/*`, `*/.claude-plugin/*`

## Phase 1: Map Text Layout Architecture

### Step 1: Identify Text View Inventory

```
Glob: **/*.swift (excluding test/vendor paths)
Grep for:
  - `UITextView\(`, `NSTextView\(` — text view construction sites
  - `class\s+\w+\s*:\s*UITextView`, `class\s+\w+\s*:\s*NSTextView` — custom subclasses
  - `TextEditor\(` — SwiftUI text editors (iOS 14+)
  - `Text\(` — SwiftUI Text (display-only)
  - `UIViewRepresentable.*UITextView`, `NSViewRepresentable.*NSTextView` — SwiftUI wrappers around UIKit/AppKit text views
```

### Step 2: Identify TextKit Surface (1 vs 2)

```
Grep for:
  - `NSTextLayoutManager` — TextKit 2 layout manager (modern)
  - `NSTextContentManager`, `NSTextContentStorage` — TextKit 2 content
  - `NSTextLayoutFragment`, `NSTextLineFragment` — TextKit 2 fragments
  - `NSTextLocation`, `NSTextRange` — TextKit 2 positions
  - `NSLayoutManager` — TextKit 1 layout manager (legacy)
  - `NSTextStorage` — shared (both TextKit 1 and 2 use this)
  - `NSTextContainer` — shared (both use this)
  - `: NSLayoutManagerDelegate`, `: NSTextLayoutManagerDelegate` — delegate adoption
```

### Step 3: Identify Glyph and Range APIs

```
Grep for:
  - `numberOfGlyphs`, `glyphRange`, `glyphIndex` — glyph-counted APIs (legacy, wrong for complex scripts)
  - `lineFragmentRect\(`, `lineFragmentUsedRect\(`, `boundingRect\(forGlyphRange` — glyph-range geometry
  - `characterIndexForGlyph`, `glyphIndexForCharacter` — character↔glyph mapping (broken for complex scripts)
  - `NSGlyph\b`, `NSGlyphInfo` — legacy glyph types (AppKit only; UIKit declares neither)
  - `enumerateTextLayoutFragments` — TextKit 2 enumeration (modern replacement)
  - `enumerateLineFragments` — TextKit 1 enumeration
```

### Step 4: Identify Writing Tools Surface (iOS 18+/macOS 15+)

```
Grep for:
  - `writingToolsBehavior` — Writing Tools behavior configuration
  - `isWritingToolsActive` — runtime state check
  - `allowedWritingToolsResultOptions` — result type filtering (iOS 18+)
  - `textViewWritingToolsWillBegin`, `textViewWritingToolsDidEnd` — lifecycle delegate methods (UITextViewDelegate, iOS 18+)
  - `UIWritingToolsCoordinator`, `NSWritingToolsCoordinator` — programmatic API
```

### Step 5: Identify Fallback Detection and SwiftUI Wrappers

```
Grep for:
  - `textLayoutManager\s*==\s*nil` — the only public UIKit fallback signal; nothing is posted when a text view falls back
  - `willSwitchToNSLayoutManagerNotification` — AppKit fallback notification
  - `\.layoutManager\b` outside of comments — direct access (forces fallback)
  - `\.textLayoutManager\b` — TextKit 2 access (preferred)
  - `usingTextLayoutManager` — explicit opt-in (`UITextView(usingTextLayoutManager: true)`, iOS 16+)
```

### Step 6: Read Key Files

Read 1-2 representative text-editor files (TextEditorView / NotesController / similar) to understand:
- Whether the implementation prefers `textLayoutManager` over `layoutManager`
- Whether glyph APIs appear in measurement code (broken on Arabic, Hebrew, Thai, Devanagari, Kannada)
- Whether Writing Tools is configured (behavior set, state checked, result options applied)
- Whether NSRange↔NSTextRange conversion happens correctly when both APIs cross
- Whether SwiftUI `UIViewRepresentable` wrappers preserve TextKit 2 behavior

### Output

Write a brief **TextKit Map** (5-10 lines) summarizing:
- Number of UITextView/NSTextView and their custom subclasses
- TextKit version in use (TextKit 2 only / TextKit 1 only / mixed / unclear)
- Glyph API sites (count, files)
- Writing Tools wiring (full / partial / absent / SwiftUI default)
- NSRange/NSTextRange usage pattern (consistent with TextKit version / mixed)
- SwiftUI integration (TextEditor / UIViewRepresentable wrapper / both)
- Custom layout fragment subclasses (yes / no)
- Fallback detection (`textLayoutManager` nil check, AppKit fallback notification observed)

Present this map in the output before proceeding.

## Phase 2: Detect Known Anti-Patterns

Run all 6 detection patterns. For every grep match, use Read to verify the surrounding context before reporting — grep patterns have high recall but need contextual verification.

### Pattern 1: TextKit 1 Fallback Triggers (CRITICAL/HIGH)

**Issue**: Direct `.layoutManager` access on a TextKit 2 text view causes a one-way silent fallback to TextKit 1. The inline Writing Tools experience goes with it — UIKit rewrites the view's `writingToolsBehavior` to `.limited`, the overlay-panel experience, when the fallback fires — and any cached TextKit 2 objects stop functioning.
**Search**:
- `\.layoutManager\b` (where the receiver is a `UITextView` or `NSTextView`)
- Verify by inspection that the result is used (not just a no-op reference)
**Verify**: Read matching files; `textView.textLayoutManager` is the TextKit 2 access; `textView.layoutManager` is the fallback trigger. Comments and dead code are false positives.
**Fix**:
```swift
if let textLayoutManager = textView.textLayoutManager {
    // TextKit 2 path
} else {
    // TextKit 1: textLayoutManager is nil, and layoutManager is non-optional here
    let layoutManager = textView.layoutManager
}
```

### Pattern 2: Direct NSLayoutManager Usage (CRITICAL/HIGH)

**Issue**: Constructing an `NSLayoutManager` or conforming to `NSLayoutManagerDelegate` ties the implementation to TextKit 1 forever. The glyph-counted APIs that come with it return wrong values for complex scripts, and the inline Writing Tools experience is not reachable on that path.
**Search**:
- `NSLayoutManager\(` — direct instantiation
- `:\s*NSLayoutManagerDelegate` — delegate conformance
- `var\s+layoutManager:\s*NSLayoutManager` — explicit ownership
**Verify**: Read matching files; flag custom code. TextKit 2 is available from iOS 16/macOS 12 — a TextKit 1 path above that is a finding, not a fallback.
**Fix**: Migrate to `NSTextLayoutManager` and `NSTextLayoutManagerDelegate`. Use `textLayoutManager.enumerateTextLayoutFragments(from:options:using:)` for measurement and read `fragment.textLineFragments` for line metrics.

### Pattern 3: Glyph-Counted APIs (CRITICAL/HIGH)

**Issue**: `numberOfGlyphs`, `glyphRange`, `glyphIndex`, and the `lineFragmentRect(forGlyphAt:...)` family return wrong values for complex scripts. Arabic ligatures, Kannada split vowels, Thai cluster shaping all break a glyph-by-glyph model.
**Search**:
- `numberOfGlyphs`
- `glyphRange`
- `glyphIndex`
- `lineFragmentRect\(`, `lineFragmentUsedRect\(`, `boundingRect\(forGlyphRange`
- `characterIndexForGlyph`
- `glyphIndexForCharacter`
- `NSGlyph\b`, `NSGlyphInfo` (AppKit only)
**Verify**: Read matching files; flag every site, even if "it works on English text" — the bug surfaces only when an international user types.
**Fix**: Use `textLayoutManager.enumerateTextLayoutFragments(...)` and read `fragment.textLineFragments` for line metrics; for character positions use `NSTextLocation`.

### Pattern 4: NSRange Mixed with TextKit 2 APIs (HIGH/MEDIUM)

**Issue**: `NSTextLayoutManager` and `NSTextContentManager` use `NSTextRange` and `NSTextLocation`, not `NSRange`, so passing one where the other is expected fails to compile. The hazard that survives compilation is the bridge: an `NSTextLocation` offset is not a UTF-16 offset, so code that treats one as the other selects or measures the wrong span.
**Search**:
- `textLayoutManager.*NSRange`
- `NSTextLayoutManager.*NSRange`
- `NSTextContentManager.*NSRange`
- `enumerateTextLayoutFragments\(from:.*NSRange`
- `textParagraphWithRange` — `NSTextContentManagerDelegate` bridge, which does take an `NSRange`
**Verify**: Read matching files; check whether the call wraps `textContentManager.location(_:offsetBy:)` to convert to `NSTextLocation`. The first four patterns are single-line and order-sensitive: they miss `textLayoutManager.textRange(from: nsRange)`, where the type name never sits next to the property — read the surrounding code, not just the match.
**Fix**:
```swift
guard
  let start = textContentManager.location(documentRange.location, offsetBy: nsRange.location),
  let end = textContentManager.location(start, offsetBy: nsRange.length),
  let textRange = NSTextRange(location: start, end: end)
else { return }
```

### Pattern 5: Missing Writing Tools Configuration (MEDIUM/MEDIUM)

**Issue**: `UITextView`/`NSTextView` instances on iOS 18+/macOS 15+ that leave Writing Tools entirely at the defaults. An unset `writingToolsBehavior` is `.default`, which resolves to the full inline experience for an editable text view, so leaving it unset loses nothing — the finding is that the editor never states its intent: no explicit behavior where the app wants `.limited` or `.none`, and no `allowedWritingToolsResultOptions`, so a plain-text editor accepts rich results and its users delete and retype.
**Search**:
- `UITextView\(`, `NSTextView\(` — count instances
- `writingToolsBehavior` — count configurations
- Files containing text views but not the behavior assignment
**Verify**: Read matching files; flag editing text views (not display-only). Flag a missing behavior only where the app's intent differs from the default, and flag `allowedWritingToolsResultOptions` left at the default in an editor whose content model is narrower than what Writing Tools can return.
**Fix**: `textView.allowedWritingToolsResultOptions = [.plainText]` to keep a plain-text editor plain; `writingToolsBehavior = .limited` where the inline experience fights the app's own layout; `.none` to opt out (rare). `.complete` only to state the default explicitly.

### Pattern 6: Missing isWritingToolsActive State Check (MEDIUM/MEDIUM)

**Issue**: Programmatic text mutation (autosave, sync, formatting) during a Writing Tools session corrupts the in-progress generation and may strand the user with a partial result.
**Search**:
- `\.text\s*=` on a UITextView/NSTextView in a sync/autosave/format/transform context
- `\.attributedText\s*=`, `\.textStorage\.setAttributedString`
- `isWritingToolsActive` — count check sites
**Verify**: Read matching files; mutations on a text view that has `writingToolsBehavior` configured should guard with `isWritingToolsActive`.
**Fix**: `guard !textView.isWritingToolsActive else { return }` before any programmatic text mutation.

## Phase 3: Reason About TextKit Completeness

Using the TextKit Map from Phase 1 and your domain knowledge, check for what's *missing* — not just what's wrong.

| Question | What it detects | Why it matters |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Does the codebase detect TextKit 1 fallback — `textLayoutManager == nil` on UIKit, `willSwitchToNSLayoutManagerNotification` (AppKit)? | Silent TextKit 1 fallback | UIKit posts nothing when a text view falls back, so an unchecked `textLayoutManager` is the only signal; the inline Writing Tools experience is downgraded to the panel with no error or log |
| For text views that handle Arabic/Hebrew/Thai/Indic input, does measurement use `enumerateTextLayoutFragments` rather than glyph APIs? | Glyph-API regression for international users | English text "works" with glyph counts; complex scripts produce off-by-multiple results that look like layout glitches |
| Is `allowedWritingToolsResultOptions` set to match the editor's content model (plain / rich / list / table)? | Wrong-result-type pollution | Users get rich text inserted into a plain-text editor, or formatted lists in a code editor; they delete and retype |
| Are programmatic text mutations gated by `isWritingToolsActive` AND the `textViewWritingToolsWillBegin`/`textViewWritingToolsDidEnd` lifecycle? | Mid-session corruption | Autosave/format/sync triggers mid-generation; the partial result + the new mutation race |
| For SwiftUI `UIViewRepresentable`/`NSViewRepresentable` wrappers around UITextView/NSTextView, are TextKit 2 properties forwarded (textLayoutManager, writingToolsBehavior)? | Wrapper drops TextKit 2 | The custom wrapper accidentally instantiates TextKit 1 paths, undoing all the TextKit 2 work in the wrapped class |
| If the app's deployment target predates TextKit 2 or it ships a Catalyst build, is the TextKit 1 path behind `if #available(iOS 16, macOS 12, *)`? | Wrong-OS fallback | TextKit 2 arrives with `UITextView.textLayoutManager` (iOS 16+) and `NSTextView.textLayoutManager` (macOS 12+); below that there is nothing to prefer, and above it the gate is dead code hiding a fallback |
| Are NSAttributedString attributes (paragraph styles, attachments, custom keys) verified to round-trip through TextKit 2 layout fragments? | Attribute loss across migration | Custom attribute keys silently disappear during TextKit 2 layout; user's formatting flickers or vanishes |
| Are large attributed-string assignments (loading a saved document) performed off-main and applied via `textStorage.setAttributedString` on main? | Main-thread stalls | A 100KB attributed string can stall the main thread for 100-500ms during typing if applied incorrectly (estimate; not measured) |
| Does the editor disable autosave / undo registration / autocorrection during an active Writing Tools session? | Writing Tools UX corruption | Undo entries from the system rewrite get tangled with user undo; autocorrect steals focus from Writing Tools UI |
| For custom `NSTextLayoutFragment` subclasses, are RTL languages tested (mirrored bounds, baseline metrics, fragment rendering origin)? | Custom-fragment RTL bug | Custom rendering looks correct in English and breaks subtly on Arabic; QA misses it |
| For SwiftUI `TextEditor`, is iOS 18+ Writing Tools support assumed (TextEditor wires it automatically)? Or is a UIViewRepresentable wrapper short-circuiting that? | Lost-by-wrapping | Wrapping `UITextView` to add a feature unintentionally forces the TextKit 1 path, which drops Writing Tools to the panel experience; user reports "feature missing" |

Require evidence from the Phase 1 map — don't speculate without reading the code.

## Phase 4: Cross-Reference Findings

Bump severity for these combinations:

| Finding A | + Finding B | = Compound | Severity |
|-----------|------------|-----------|----------|
| Direct `.layoutManager` access (Pattern 1) | iOS 18+ deployment target + UITextView with edit content | Silent Writing Tools downgrade — the inline experience becomes the overlay panel — plus the loss of every TextKit 2 object the view had cached | CRITICAL |
| Glyph APIs (Pattern 3) | Codebase ships in non-English locales | Layout corruption + measurement errors for any user typing Arabic/Hebrew/Thai/Indic | CRITICAL |
| NSLayoutManager subclass (Pattern 2) | Custom rendering / decoration drawing | No migration path to TextKit 2 without ground-up rewrite of the rendering pipeline | HIGH |
| Unstated Writing Tools behavior/result options (Pattern 5) | iOS 18+ deployment + edit-rich app (notes, mail, social) | A plain-text editor accepts rich results, or a view meant to limit the experience keeps the full one; behavior drifts from the app's intent | HIGH |
| NSRange + TextKit 2 API (Pattern 4) | Document with structured content (multiple text containers, tables) | An `NSTextLocation` offset treated as a UTF-16 offset selects or measures the wrong span; selections jump or break, and the compiler only catches the direct type mismatch | HIGH |
| Missing `isWritingToolsActive` check (Pattern 6) | Autosave timer / sync timer / network mutation | Mid-Writing-Tools-generation mutation corrupts the result; user sees partial text + autosave wiping their work | HIGH |
| TextKit 1 fallback trigger | Custom NSAttributedString attribute keys | Attributes silently lost when fallback occurs; user's bold/color/link disappears with no error | HIGH |
| SwiftUI UIViewRepresentable wrapper (Phase 3) | Missing forwarding of `writingToolsBehavior`/`textLayoutManager` | Wrapper undoes TextKit 2 work; the parent app thinks it's modern but the wrapped view is not | HIGH |
| Large attributed-string load (Phase 3) | Main-thread assignment | 100-500ms typing stall on document load (estimate; not measured); users perceive "lag" without root cause | MEDIUM |
| Custom `NSTextLayoutFragment` (Phase 3) | RTL/Indic untested | Custom-rendered editor breaks for international users; ships with no test coverage | MEDIUM |

Cross-auditor overlap notes:
- Background `NSAttributedString` construction crossing actor boundaries → compound with `concurrency-auditor`
- Large document loads stalling main thread → compound with `swift-performance-analyzer`
- Custom text view that breaks VoiceOver navigation → compound with `accessibility-auditor`
- TextKit 1 fallback losing rotor / Mark Up support → compound with `accessibility-auditor`
- SwiftUI `UIViewRepresentable` wrapper churn re-creating the text view → compound with `swiftui-performance-analyzer`
- Saved-document file location and protection → compound with `storage-auditor`

## Phase 5: TextKit Modernity Health Score

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Text view count | N UITextView/NSTextView/TextEditor instances |
| TextKit version | TextKit 2 / TextKit 1 / mixed |
| Glyph API sites | M glyph-API references |
| Writing Tools coverage | M of N edit views whose behavior/result options match stated intent (Z%) |
| State-check discipline | M of N programmatic mutations check `isWritingToolsActive` (Z%) |
| Range type discipline | NSTextRange used with TextKit 2 / mixed with NSRange |
| Fallback detection | `textLayoutManager` nil check / AppKit notification observed / neither |
| SwiftUI wrapper hygiene | TextKit 2 properties forwarded / dropped / N/A |
| **Health** | **MODERN / MIXED / LEGACY** |

Scoring:
- **MODERN**: No CRITICAL issues, all text views on TextKit 2 with `textLayoutManager`, no glyph APIs, Writing Tools behavior and result options stated where the defaults don't fit, `isWritingToolsActive` checked at every programmatic mutation, NSRange↔NSTextRange conversion explicit at boundaries, fallback detected (nil check or AppKit notification).
- **MIXED**: Some TextKit 2 surface but TextKit 1 fallback paths fire silently, Writing Tools intent unstated where the defaults don't fit, glyph APIs in measurement code that "works" for English but breaks on complex scripts, range types mixed without explicit conversion.
- **LEGACY**: TextKit 1 only or majority TextKit 1 (`NSLayoutManager` direct usage, glyph APIs throughout, no Writing Tools wiring, no fallback detection). The inline Writing Tools experience is unavailable to users; international users see broken layout.

```

## Output Limits

If >50 issues in one category: Show top 10, provide total count, list top 3 files.
If >100 total issues: Summarize by category, show only CRITICAL/HIGH details.

## False Positives (Not Issues)

- `layoutManager` mentioned only in comments or documentation strings
- Glyph APIs in code paths that operate on monospaced ASCII content (rare but valid: terminal emulators, code that explicitly disclaims international support)
- Display-only `Text(...)` SwiftUI views (no editing, no Writing Tools concern)
- `UITextField` (single-line; uses different layout system; not in scope)
- `NSAttributedString` construction in non-text-view contexts (e.g., for Drawing/PDFKit)
- `writingToolsBehavior` not set on text views with `isEditable = false` (Writing Tools is for edit content)
