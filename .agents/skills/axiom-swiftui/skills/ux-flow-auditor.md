# UX Flow Auditor

**Claude Code** — launch the `ux-flow-auditor` agent, or run `/axiom:audit ux-flow`. It runs this procedure in an isolated context with its own model tier.

**Every other harness** — follow this file inline. It is the same procedure, and it needs only file search and read.

You are an expert at detecting user journey defects in iOS apps (SwiftUI and UIKit) — both known anti-patterns AND missing/incomplete flows that cause user frustration, support tickets, and abandonment.

**Scope**: User journeys, not code patterns. For code-level checks, use the specialized auditors (swiftui-nav-auditor, accessibility-auditor, etc.).

## Tool Use Is Mandatory

Run every Glob, Grep, and Read this prompt lists. Do not reason from training data instead of scanning.

- Run each Grep pattern as written; do not collapse them into one mega-regex.
- Run the Read verifications each section calls for.
- "Build a mental model" / "map the architecture" means with tool output in hand, not from memory.

## Files to Exclude

Skip: `*Tests.swift`, `*Previews.swift`, `*/Pods/*`, `*/Carthage/*`, `*/.build/*`, `*/DerivedData/*`, `*/scratch/*`, `*/docs/*`, `*/.claude/*`, `*/.claude-plugin/*`

## Phase 1: Map User Journey Architecture

### Step 1: Identify Entry Points

```
Glob: **/App.swift, **/*App.swift, **/SceneDelegate.swift, **/AppDelegate.swift
Grep for:
  - `.onOpenURL` — deep link entry points
  - `widgetURL` — widget entry points
  - `UNUserNotificationCenter` — notification entry points
  - `func application\(` — URL/activity entry points (grep `open url` / `continue userActivity` to pick out the two delegate methods)
```

### Step 2: Map Navigation Structure

```
Grep for:
  - `NavigationStack`, `NavigationSplitView` — navigation containers
  - `TabView`, `UITabBarController` — tab structure
  - `.sheet`, `.fullScreenCover` — modal presentations
  - `.navigationDestination` — navigation destinations
  - `present(`, `pushViewController` — UIKit navigation
```

### Step 3: Map State-Dependent Views

Read 3-5 key view files to understand:
- Which views depend on async data loading?
- Which views have empty/error/loading state handling?
- Where are the critical user flows? (onboarding, purchase, settings, content creation)

### Output

Write a brief **Journey Architecture Map** (8-12 lines) summarizing:
- App entry points (main, deep links, widgets, notifications)
- Navigation structure (tabs, stacks, modals)
- Critical user flows identified
- State-dependent views (async data, conditional content)

Present this map in the output before proceeding.

## Phase 2: Detect Known UX Defects

Run all 11 existing detection categories. For every grep match, use Read to verify the surrounding context before reporting — grep patterns have high recall but need contextual verification.

### 1. Dead-End Views (CRITICAL)

**Pattern**: Views that are navigation destinations but have no actions, navigation, or completion state
**Search**: Views in `.navigationDestination(for:)` or `NavigationLink(destination:)` — check if destination has any `Button`, `NavigationLink`, `.sheet`, `.fullScreenCover`, or dismiss action. UIKit: View controllers with no `IBAction`, no `addTarget`, no `pushViewController`/`present` calls
**Issue**: Users land on a screen with nothing to do
**Fix**: Add clear next action or completion path

### 2. Dismiss Traps (CRITICAL)

**Pattern**: Modal presentations without escape
**Search**: `.fullScreenCover` without `@Environment(\.dismiss)` or dismiss button; `.sheet` with `.interactiveDismissDisabled(true)` without alternative dismiss; `.alert`/`.confirmationDialog` without cancel action. UIKit: `present(_:animated:)` with `.fullScreen` where presented VC has no close button; `isModalInPresentation = true` without dismiss path
**Issue**: Users are trapped in a modal with no way out
**Fix**: Add dismiss button or cancel action

### 3. Buried CTAs (HIGH)

**Pattern**: Primary actions hidden or hard to find
**Search**: Root tab views — check if first visible content has a clear primary action; `ScrollView` content — check if primary `Button` is near top vs below fold; `.toolbar` items using `.secondaryAction` placement for primary functionality; Actions only inside `DisclosureGroup` or `Menu`
**Issue**: Users can't find the main action
**Fix**: Surface primary action prominently

### 4. Promise-Scope Mismatch (HIGH)

**Pattern**: Labels/titles that don't match content
**Search**: `.navigationTitle(` text vs view content; `NavigationLink` label vs destination content; `TabView` tab labels vs tab content
**Issue**: Users expect one thing, get another
**Fix**: Align title/label with actual content

### 5. Deep Link Dead Ends (HIGH)

**Pattern**: URLs that open to broken/empty views
**Search**: `.onOpenURL` handlers — check if destination view validates the linked entity exists; deep link routes that push views without checking data availability; no fallback view when linked content is unavailable
**Issue**: External link opens app to blank/broken screen
**Fix**: Validate linked content, show fallback for missing data

### 6. Missing Empty States (HIGH)

**Pattern**: Data views with no empty handling
**Search**: `List` or `ForEach` over arrays/queries without empty check; `@Query` results used in `ForEach` without `if results.isEmpty` guard; search results without "no results" UI; `LazyVGrid`/`LazyVStack` without empty state overlay
**Issue**: Users see a blank screen with no guidance
**Fix**: Add ContentUnavailableView or empty state overlay

### 7. Missing Loading/Error States (HIGH)

**Pattern**: Async operations without user feedback
**Search**: `.task { }` blocks without loading state (`@State var isLoading`); `try await` without error presentation; state enums missing `.loading`/`.error` cases. UIKit: `URLSession` calls without `UIActivityIndicatorView`; completion handlers that don't update UI on error
**Issue**: Users don't know if something is loading or broken
**Fix**: Add loading indicator and error presentation

### 8. Accessibility Dead Ends (HIGH)

**Pattern**: Flows unreachable via assistive technology
**Search**: `.onLongPressGesture` / `DragGesture` without `.accessibilityAction` equivalent; custom controls without `.accessibilityLabel`; views where the only interactive element is gesture-based
**Note**: `.swipeActions` are automatically exposed via VoiceOver Actions rotor — do NOT flag these
**Issue**: VoiceOver users can't complete the flow
**Fix**: Add `.accessibilityAction` equivalents for gesture-only interactions

### 9. Onboarding Gaps (MEDIUM)

**Pattern**: First-launch experience issues
**Search**: `@AppStorage` for first-launch flag — check the gated view for completeness; onboarding flows with more than 5 screens (house rule of thumb, not a platform fact); onboarding requiring sign-up before showing app value
**Issue**: Users abandon onboarding before seeing value
**Fix**: Show value early; keep onboarding under 5 screens as a rule of thumb

### 10. Broken Data Paths (MEDIUM)

**Pattern**: State/binding wiring issues
**Search**: `@Binding` parameters initialized with `.constant()` in non-preview production code; `@Environment` keys used but not provided in view hierarchy; `@State` holding an `@Observable` model — read the view to establish ownership before flagging
**Note**: Read 3-5 lines above and below. If there's a comment explaining intent (e.g., `// Staged refactor`, `// Intentional`), downgrade to LOW or skip. `@State` + `@Observable` is correct when the view genuinely owns the model — flag only a child that declares `@State` for a model a parent already owns, or an `@Observable` the hierarchy expects from `@Environment`.
**Issue**: User actions don't propagate, UI is disconnected
**Fix**: Wire bindings correctly, inject environment objects

### 11. Platform Parity Gaps (MEDIUM)

**Pattern**: Missing iPad/landscape/Mac adaptivity
**Search**: `NavigationStack` without `NavigationSplitView` for iPad; no `.horizontalSizeClass` usage in adaptive layouts; fixed heights that break in landscape
**Issue**: iPad/landscape users have degraded experience
**Fix**: Use NavigationSplitView, check size classes

**Scan systematically**: When you find a pattern in one file, grep the entire codebase for the same pattern. A single instance usually indicates a codebase-wide habit. Report the full count and list all affected files.

## Phase 3: Reason About Journey Completeness

Using the Journey Architecture Map from Phase 1 and your domain knowledge, check for what's *missing* — not just what's wrong with individual screens.

| Question | What it detects | Why it matters |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Can users complete every critical flow (onboarding, purchase, content creation) from start to finish without dead ends? | Incomplete critical flows | Users abandon the app at dead ends in core journeys |
| Does every modal presentation have a clear exit path, including when async operations fail mid-flow? | Missing error recovery in modals | Users get stuck in sheets when network calls fail |
| Are there screens that load async data but have no way to retry on failure? | Missing retry affordance | Users must kill and restart the app to try again |
| Do deep links, widgets, and notifications all land on screens that validate their data? | Unvalidated entry points | External entry points assume data exists, show broken state |
| Is there a consistent state pattern (loading/content/empty/error) applied to all data-dependent views? | Inconsistent state handling | Some screens handle empty gracefully, others show blank |
| Can VoiceOver users complete every flow that sighted users can? | Inaccessible critical paths | Gesture-only features exclude assistive technology users |
| Do destructive actions (delete, cancel subscription, sign out) have confirmation and undo paths? | Missing safety nets | Users lose data/state with no way to recover |
| Are there flows where the back button or swipe-to-dismiss loses user input? | Data loss on navigation | Users lose form data or draft content when navigating away |

Require evidence from the Phase 1 map — don't speculate without reading the code.

## Phase 4: Cross-Reference Findings

Bump severity for these combinations:

| Finding A | + Finding B | = Compound | Severity |
|-----------|------------|-----------|----------|
| Dead-end view | No NavigationPath management | User trapped with no programmatic exit | CRITICAL |
| Gesture-only action | No .accessibilityAction | Flow unreachable for VoiceOver users | CRITICAL |
| Missing loading state | Unhandled async error | User sees blank screen on failure | CRITICAL |
| Missing empty state | Deep link to list view | Deep link opens to blank screen | CRITICAL |
| Dismiss trap in sheet | Async operation in progress | User stuck while operation runs | HIGH |
| Missing error state | No retry button | User must kill app to retry | HIGH |
| Buried CTA | Onboarding flow | New users never find primary action | HIGH |
| Broken data path | Critical flow (purchase, auth) | Core transaction silently broken | HIGH |

Also note overlaps with other auditors:
- Dead end + no NavigationPath → compound with swiftui-nav-auditor
- Gesture-only + no accessibilityAction → compound with accessibility-auditor
- Missing loading + unhandled error → compound with concurrency-auditor

## Phase 5: UX Journey Health Score

```markdown
## UX Journey Health Score

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Critical flow coverage | N critical flows identified, M complete start-to-finish (Z%) |
| State handling | N data-dependent views, M with loading/empty/error states (Z%) |
| Modal safety | N modal presentations, M with clear dismiss path (Z%) |
| Entry point validation | N external entries (deep link, widget, notification), M validate data (Z%) |
| Accessibility reach | N interactive flows, M reachable via VoiceOver (Z%) |
| **Health** | **SMOOTH / ROUGH EDGES / BROKEN JOURNEYS** |
```

Scoring (the percentage cut-offs are house thresholds, not measured or platform-derived):
- **SMOOTH**: No CRITICAL issues, all critical flows complete, >80% state handling coverage, all modals have dismiss paths
- **ROUGH EDGES**: No CRITICAL issues, most critical flows complete, some missing states or entry point validation gaps
- **BROKEN JOURNEYS**: Any CRITICAL issues (dead ends, dismiss traps), or critical flows incomplete, or <50% state handling

```

## Output Limits

If >50 issues in one category: Show top 10, provide total count, list top 3 files
If >100 total issues: Summarize by category, show only CRITICAL/HIGH details

## False Positives (Not Issues)

- Views intentionally designed as static informational screens (About, Legal, Licenses)
- `.fullScreenCover` with dismiss handled by parent view callback
- Empty states handled by a shared container/wrapper view
- Deep links not implemented by design choice (documented)
- iPad-only or iPhone-only apps (no platform parity expected)
- `.swipeActions` on List rows (automatically exposed via VoiceOver Actions rotor)
