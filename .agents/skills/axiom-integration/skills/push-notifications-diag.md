# Push Notification Diagnostics

Systematic troubleshooting for push notification failures: missing notifications, token registration errors, environment mismatches, silent push throttling, and service extension problems.

## Overview

**Core Principle**: When push notifications don't work, the problem is usually:
1. **Token/registration failures** (never registered, wrong format, expired)
2. **Entitlement/provisioning mismatch** (capability missing, wrong environment)
3. **Payload structure errors** (missing keys, wrong types, invalid JSON)
4. **Focus/interruption suppression** (iOS 15+ filtering, provisional auth)
5. **Service extension failures** (timeout, crash, missing mutable-content)
6. **Delivery timing/throttling** (silent push budget, APNs coalescing)

**Always verify entitlements and token registration BEFORE debugging payload or delivery logic.**

## Red Flags

Symptoms that indicate push-specific issues:

| Symptom | Likely Cause |
|---------|--------------|
| No notifications at all | Missing Push Notification capability or provisioning profile |
| Works in dev, not production | Sending to sandbox APNs with production token (or vice versa) |
| Token registration fails on Simulator | Rare on Apple silicon/T2 — since iOS 16 the Simulator registers and receives pushes through the APNs sandbox. Check network reachability and the aps-environment entitlement |
| Notifications appear without sound | Missing .sound in authorization options or payload |
| Rich notification shows plain text | Missing mutable-content: 1 in payload |
| Image not showing in notification | Service extension failed silently — check serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire |
| Plain text though mutable-content is set | NSE never called contentHandler before the budget expired and serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire has no fallback. The system delivers the original, unmodified notification |
| NSE never fires at all | Extension bundle ID prefix wrong. Must be {host-app-bundle-id}.SomeName — a mismatched prefix means the NSE silently never runs, no crash, no log |
| Silent push not waking app | System throttling (~2-3/hour), or app was force-quit by user |
| Notifications stopped after iOS update | Focus mode enabled by default in iOS 15+; check interruption level |
| Badge shows wrong number | Multiple notifications sent without explicit badge count reset |
| Actions not appearing | Category identifier mismatch between payload and registered categories |
| Notification appears twice | Both local and remote notification scheduled for same event |
| FCM works on Android, not iOS | Missing APNs auth key upload in Firebase Console |

## Anti-Rationalization

| Rationalization | Why It Fails | Time Cost |
|----------------|--------------|-----------|
| "It worked yesterday, so entitlements are fine" | Provisioning profiles get regenerated during signing changes. Always re-verify. | 30-60 min debugging code when the profile lost push capability |
| "The server says their payload is fine" | Entitlement and token problems are client-side; verify them independently with curl before accepting the server's word. | 1-2 hours of finger-pointing before someone checks |
| "I'll skip token verification, the error is clearly in the payload" | Wrong-environment tokens are the #1 cause of "works in dev, not production." | 30+ min debugging valid payloads sent to invalid tokens |
| "Focus mode doesn't matter, we use default interruption level" | Default (`active`) is filtered by Focus. Only `time-sensitive` and `critical` break through. | Hours adding code workarounds for a payload-level fix |
| "Silent push is reliable, we use it for sync" | System throttles to ~2-3/hour and ignores force-quit apps. It's a hint, not a guarantee. | Architecture rework when silent push can't sustain real-time sync |
| "Service extension is set up, so rich notifications should work" | Extension needs correct bundle ID suffix, mutable-content in payload, AND completing within 30s. | 30+ min when any one of the three prerequisites is missing |
| "FCM handles everything, I don't need to understand APNs" | FCM wraps APNs. Token type confusion, missing p8 key upload, and swizzling conflicts are all APNs-level problems. | Hours debugging FCM when the issue is APNs configuration |
| "I'll test on Simulator first" | On Apple silicon/T2 the Simulator registers and receives APNs sandbox pushes, but `simctl push` delivers only app notifications — VoIP, complication and other push types still need a device. | A test cycle spent discovering which Simulator limits are real |
| "Let me rewrite the notification handler" | Configuration — entitlements, tokens, environment — is what to verify first; Steps 1-4 are cheap and decisive. | Hours rewriting working code while the config stays broken |
| "This worked on iOS 17, the bug must be in our code" | Each iOS version changes Focus defaults, interruption filtering, and provisional behavior. | Debugging code when the fix is a payload or Settings change |
| "Just send the push 50 times so it gets through" | Resending the same payload stacks 50 banners and gets you flagged for APNs abuse. Reliable delivery is a header problem, not a volume problem — use apns-expiration for store-and-forward and apns-collapse-id to replace, not stack. | Spam complaints and 1-star reviews; the real fix was two headers |
| "Push is flaky, just poll the server every minute" | Polling drains battery, wastes server load, and is rejected by App Review for background abuse. APNs already does store-and-forward to offline devices via apns-expiration. | Battery drain, App Review rejection, infra cost for a problem APNs solves for free |

## Mandatory First Steps

Before investigating code, run these diagnostics:

### Step 1: Verify Push Notification Entitlements

```bash
security cms -D -i path/to/embedded.mobileprovision | grep -A1 "aps-environment"
```

**Expected output**:
- ✅ `<string>development</string>` or `<string>production</string>` → Entitlement present
- ❌ No aps-environment key → Push Notifications capability not enabled in Xcode

**How to find the provisioning profile**:
```bash
# For installed app on device
find ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData -name "embedded.mobileprovision" -newer . 2>/dev/null | head -3
```

### Step 2: Check Token Registration

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                 didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {
    let token = deviceToken.map { String(format: "%02x", $0) }.joined()
    print("✅ APNs token: \(token)")
    print("✅ Token length: \(token.count) chars")
}

func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                 didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError error: Error) {
    print("❌ Registration failed: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

**Expected output**:
- ✅ A hex device token of the platform's current length → Registration successful (device tokens are variable length — never assert a length)
- ❌ "no valid 'aps-environment' entitlement string" → Capability misconfigured
- ❌ No callback fires at all → `registerForRemoteNotifications()` never called

**Critical**: Both callbacks must be in `AppDelegate`, not `SceneDelegate`. SwiftUI apps need `@UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor`.

### Step 3: Validate Payload with curl

```bash
curl -v \
  --header "apns-topic: com.your.bundle.id" \
  --header "apns-push-type: alert" \
  --header "authorization: bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
  --data '{"aps":{"alert":{"title":"Test","body":"Hello"}}}' \
  --http2 https://api.sandbox.push.apple.com/3/device/$DEVICE_TOKEN
```

**Expected output**:
- ✅ HTTP/2 200 → Payload accepted by APNs
- ❌ 400 BadDeviceToken → Token format wrong or expired
- ❌ 403 ExpiredProviderToken → JWT older than 1 hour
- ❌ 403 InvalidProviderToken → Wrong key ID, team ID, or key
- ❌ 410 Unregistered → App uninstalled or token invalidated
- ❌ 413 PayloadTooLarge → Exceeds 4096 bytes

### Step 4: Check Authorization Status

```swift
let settings = await UNUserNotificationCenter.current().notificationSettings()
print("Authorization: \(settings.authorizationStatus.rawValue)")
print("Alert: \(settings.alertSetting.rawValue)")
print("Sound: \(settings.soundSetting.rawValue)")
print("Badge: \(settings.badgeSetting.rawValue)")
```

**Expected output**:
- ✅ authorizationStatus = 2 → Authorized
- ⚠️ authorizationStatus = 3 → Provisional (appears silently in Notification Center)
- ❌ authorizationStatus = 1 → Denied by user
- ❌ authorizationStatus = 0 → Not determined (never requested)

## Delivery Levers (Use Instead of Spamming)

When delivery feels unreliable, the fix is APNs headers, not volume. Resending the same payload N times stacks N banners and risks abuse flagging. These levers solve "it didn't arrive" without spamming.

| Lever | Header | What it does |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| Store-and-forward | apns-expiration: <unix-ts> | APNs holds the push and delivers when an offline device reconnects. Set 0 for "deliver now or discard"; set a future timestamp for "keep trying until then." Default behavior already retries — use this to control the window |
| Replace, not stack | apns-collapse-id: <string> | A new push with the same collapse ID overwrites the previous one on the device instead of adding a second banner. This is how you "update" a notification (score changes, delivery status) without piling up |
| Priority by urgency | apns-priority: 10 (immediate) / 5 (power-considerate) | 10 for user-visible alerts; 5 for background/silent and batchable updates. Wrong priority gets silent pushes throttled harder |
| Drop dead tokens | 410 Unregistered response | When APNs returns 410, the device token is permanently invalid (app uninstalled / token rotated). Delete it from your server immediately. Continuing to send to 410 tokens is a leading abuse signal |

**Key insight** "Send it 50 times" and "just poll" are both volume answers to a header problem. apns-expiration gives offline delivery for free; apns-collapse-id replaces instead of stacks. Reach for these before adding retry loops or polling.

## Decision Trees

### Tree 1: Not Receiving Any Notifications

```
Not receiving any notifications?
│
├─ Check Step 1 (entitlements)
│  ├─ No aps-environment key?
│  │  └─ Enable Push Notifications in Signing & Capabilities → DONE
│  └─ aps-environment present → continue
│
├─ Check Step 2 (token registration)
│  ├─ didFailToRegister called?
│  │  ├─ "no valid 'aps-environment' entitlement string" → Enable Push Notifications in Signing & Capabilities, then re-download the provisioning profile
│  │  └─ Other error → Check network reachability and APNs reachability
│  ├─ Neither callback fires?
│  │  └─ Verify registerForRemoteNotifications() called after app launch
│  └─ Token received → continue
│
├─ Check Step 3 (payload delivery)
│  ├─ HTTP 200 but no notification?
│  │  └─ Check Step 4 (authorization status)
│  ├─ 400 BadDeviceToken?
│  │  └─ Token expired or wrong environment → Re-register
│  └─ 403/410 error?
│     └─ Fix auth credentials or re-register device
│
└─ Check Step 4 (user authorization)
   ├─ Status: denied?
   │  └─ User must enable in Settings → Show settings prompt
   ├─ Status: notDetermined?
   │  └─ Call requestAuthorization() → Was never requested
   └─ Status: authorized but still no notifications?
      └─ Check Focus mode, Do Not Disturb, notification grouping
```

### Tree 2: Works in Dev, Not Production

```
Works in development, fails in production?
│
├─ APNs endpoint correct?
│  ├─ Dev: api.sandbox.push.apple.com
│  └─ Prod: api.push.apple.com
│     └─ Using sandbox endpoint with production build? → Switch endpoint
│
├─ Token environment matches?
│  ├─ Dev and production tokens are DIFFERENT
│  │  └─ Server storing dev token, sending to prod APNs? → Re-register on prod build
│  └─ Server distinguishes token environments? → Add environment flag to token storage
│
├─ Auth method correct?
│  ├─ .p8 key (token-based)?
│  │  └─ Same key works for both environments ✅
│  └─ .p12 certificate?
│     ├─ Dev cert → Only works with sandbox
│     └─ Prod cert → Only works with production
│        └─ Wrong cert for environment? → Generate correct certificate
│
└─ Using FCM?
   ├─ APNs auth key (.p8) uploaded to Firebase Console?
   │  └─ Missing? → Upload in Project Settings > Cloud Messaging
   └─ Key uploaded but wrong Team ID?
      └─ Verify Team ID matches Apple Developer account
```

**Key insight** A `.p8` token-based auth key works for BOTH sandbox and production — only the endpoint (api.sandbox.push.apple.com vs api.push.apple.com) changes. Switching from `.p12` certificates to `.p8` eliminates an entire class of "wrong cert for environment" bugs, because there is no per-environment credential to get wrong.

### Tree 3: Silent Notifications Not Waking App

```
Silent push not waking app?
│
├─ Payload correct?
│  ├─ Has "content-available": 1 in aps?
│  │  └─ Missing? → Add to aps dictionary
│  ├─ Has NO "alert", "badge", or "sound" in aps?
│  │  └─ Has alert? → Not a silent push; system treats as visible notification
│  └─ Payload valid → continue
│
├─ Headers correct?
│  ├─ apns-push-type: background?
│  │  └─ Missing or wrong? → Must be "background" for silent push
│  └─ apns-priority: 5?
│     └─ Using 10? → Silent push MUST use priority 5
│
├─ Background mode enabled?
│  ├─ "Remote notifications" checked in Background Modes capability?
│  │  └─ Missing? → Enable in Signing & Capabilities
│  └─ application(_:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler:) implemented?
│     └─ Missing? → Implement the delegate method
│
├─ App state?
│  ├─ Force-quit by user (swiped up)?
│  │  └─ System will NOT wake force-quit apps for silent push
│  └─ Suspended or background?
│     └─ Should wake — continue debugging
│
└─ System throttling?
   ├─ Budget: ~2-3 silent pushes per hour
   │  └─ Exceeding? → Reduce frequency, batch updates
   └─ Device in Low Power Mode?
      └─ Further reduces background execution budget
```

### Tree 4: Rich Notification Missing Media

```
Rich notification not showing image/video?
│
├─ Payload has mutable-content: 1?
│  └─ Missing? → Required for Notification Service Extension to fire
│
├─ Notification Service Extension target exists?
│  ├─ Missing? → File > New > Target > Notification Service Extension
│  └─ Exists → continue
│
├─ Extension bundle ID correct?
│  ├─ Must be: {host-app-bundle-id}.SomeName
│  │  Example: com.myapp.NotificationService
│  └─ Wrong prefix? → NSE SILENTLY never fires (no crash, no log).
│     Fix bundle ID so prefix exactly matches parent app
│
├─ Download completing in time?
│  ├─ Extension has ~30 seconds to modify notification
│  │  └─ Large file? → Use thumbnail URL, not full resolution
│  └─ serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire calls contentHandler with a fallback?
│     ├─ No fallback? → the system delivers the original, unmodified content
│     │  when the budget expires — the media is dropped, the text is not
│     └─ Always call contentHandler(bestAttemptContent) here so the
│        text notification still shows even if the media download stalls
│
├─ Attachment created correctly?
│  ├─ File written to disk before creating UNNotificationAttachment?
│  │  └─ Must write to tmp directory, then create attachment from file URL
│  └─ File type supported?
│     ├─ Images: JPEG, GIF, PNG (max 10MB)
│     ├─ Audio: AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A (max 5MB)
│     └─ Video: MPEG, MPEG-2, MP4, AVI (max 50MB)
│
└─ App groups configured?
   └─ Extension and app share data via App Groups?
      └─ Missing? → Add same App Group to both targets
```

#### NSE Timeout Fallback (Prevents the Media Being Dropped)

The expiration handler is not optional. Without it, a stalled download lets the ~30s budget run out and the system delivers the original, unmodified content — the media you downloaded never appears, which is worse than the plain-text version the user would have seen with no NSE at all.

```swift
class NotificationService: UNNotificationServiceExtension {
    var contentHandler: ((UNNotificationContent) -> Void)?
    var bestAttemptContent: UNMutableNotificationContent?

    override func didReceive(_ request: UNNotificationRequest,
                             withContentHandler contentHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationContent) -> Void) {
        self.contentHandler = contentHandler
        bestAttemptContent = request.content.mutableCopy() as? UNMutableNotificationContent
        // ... download media, attach, then call contentHandler(bestAttemptContent!) ...
    }

    override func serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire() {
        // Budget about to expire — deliver what we have so the media is not dropped.
        if let contentHandler, let bestAttemptContent {
            contentHandler(bestAttemptContent)
        }
    }
}
```

### Tree 5: Live Activity Not Updating via Push

```
Live Activity not updating from push?
│
├─ APNs topic correct?
│  ├─ Must be: {bundleID}.push-type.liveactivity
│  │  └─ Using plain bundle ID? → Append .push-type.liveactivity
│  └─ Topic correct → continue
│
├─ Push type header correct?
│  ├─ apns-push-type: liveactivity?
│  │  └─ Using "alert"? → Must be "liveactivity"
│  └─ Correct → continue
│
├─ Content-state matches ActivityAttributes.ContentState?
│  ├─ JSON keys match Swift property names exactly?
│  │  └─ Mismatch? → Decoding fails silently
│  └─ Using custom CodingKeys or JSONEncoder strategies?
│     └─ Custom strategies NOT supported — use default key encoding
│
├─ Push token being sent to server?
│  ├─ Observing pushTokenUpdates on the Activity?
│  │  └─ Missing? → Must iterate Activity.pushTokenUpdates async sequence
│  └─ Token changes when Activity restarts?
│     └─ Must handle token rotation — send updated token to server
│
└─ Rate limiting?
   ├─ Frequent updates: a per-hour budget Apple does not publish, and which
   │  depends on device condition
   │  └─ Exceeding? → Batch updates, reduce frequency; NSSupportsLiveActivitiesFrequentUpdates raises the budget
   └─ Alert updates (sound/vibration): priority-10 updates are delivered
      immediately but draw on the same budget
      └─ Exceeding? → Reserve alerts for critical state changes
```

### Tree 6: Notifications Stopped After iOS Update

```
Notifications stopped working after iOS update?
│
├─ Focus mode auto-enabled? (iOS 15+)
│  ├─ Check Settings > Focus
│  │  └─ Focus active? → App may not be in allowed list
│  └─ No Focus active → continue
│
├─ Interruption level filtering?
│  ├─ Default level is .active (may be filtered by Focus)
│  │  └─ Need to break through Focus? → Use .timeSensitive or .critical
│  ├─ .timeSensitive requires capability
│  │  └─ Missing? → Add Time Sensitive Notifications capability
│  └─ .critical requires Apple entitlement
│     └─ Only for health/safety/security apps — apply via Apple Developer
│
├─ Provisional authorization behavior changed?
│  ├─ Provisional notifications (iOS 12+) are delivered quietly — no banner,
│  │  no sound, not on the Lock Screen; they only appear in Notification Center history
│  │  └─ User may not see them → Request full authorization
│  └─ Was relying on provisional? → Prompt for explicit permission
│
└─ Communication notifications require INSendMessageIntent?
   ├─ iOS 15+ communication notifications need SiriKit intent
   │  └─ Missing? → Donate INSendMessageIntent before showing notification
   └─ Intent donated but still filtered?
      └─ Check that sender is in user's contacts
```

## Push Notification Console Workflow

Apple's Push Notification Console provides server-free testing:

#### Navigate to Console

1. Open https://icloud.developer.apple.com/dashboard
2. Select "Push Notifications" from sidebar
3. Choose your app's bundle ID

#### Send Test Notification

1. Enter device token (from Step 2 diagnostic)
2. Select environment (Sandbox/Production)
3. Compose payload or use template
4. Send and observe delivery status

#### Check Delivery Logs

1. Copy `apns-id` from the response header of your push request
2. Use Push Notification Console to look up delivery status by `apns-id`
3. Status shows: accepted, delivered, dropped (with reason)

#### Common Console Findings

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Delivered | APNs delivered to device | Problem is on-device (auth, Focus, extension) |
| Dropped: Unregistered | Token invalid | Re-register device |
| Dropped: DeviceTokenNotForTopic | Bundle ID mismatch | Fix apns-topic header |
| Stored | Device offline, will deliver later | Wait or check device connectivity |

## Simulator Testing with simctl

On Apple silicon and T2 Macs the iOS 16+ Simulator registers for remote notifications itself and receives real pushes from the APNs sandbox (`api.sandbox.push.apple.com`). `simctl push` is the server-free alternative — it injects a payload locally, so no APNs round trip happens:

```bash
cat > test-push.apns << 'EOF'
{
  "Simulator Target Bundle": "com.your.bundle.id",
  "aps": {
    "alert": {
      "title": "Test",
      "body": "Hello from simctl"
    },
    "sound": "default",
    "mutable-content": 1
  }
}
EOF

xcrun simctl push booted com.your.bundle.id test-push.apns
```

#### Simulator Limitations

- ✅ Notification appearance and content
- ✅ Notification Service Extension processing
- ✅ Notification Content Extension (custom UI)
- ✅ Action handling and categories
- ✅ APNs token registration and sandbox delivery (Apple silicon/T2, iOS 16+)
- ❌ VoIP, Complication, File Provider, and other non-app push types via `simctl push` — only application remote notifications are supported
- ❌ Real-device silent-push throttling and battery behaviour (the Simulator has no equivalent budget)
- ❌ Live Activity push via `simctl push` — send it through the APNs sandbox instead

#### Drag-and-Drop Alternative

Drag a `.apns` file directly onto the Simulator window to deliver it. Requires `"Simulator Target Bundle"` key in the payload.

## Common FCM Diagnostics

### Swizzling Conflict

**Symptom**: Token callback not firing with Firebase

**Cause**: Method swizzling disabled but manual forwarding not implemented

**Diagnostic**:
```swift
// Check Info.plist
// FirebaseAppDelegateProxyEnabled = NO means YOU must forward tokens
```

**Fix** (if swizzling disabled):
```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                 didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {
    Messaging.messaging().apnsToken = deviceToken
}
```

### Token Mismatch

**Symptom**: Server has FCM token, but APNs delivery fails

**Cause**: FCM token and APNs token are different. FCM wraps APNs token.

**Diagnostic**:
```swift
// FCM token (send this to YOUR server)
Messaging.messaging().token { token, error in
    print("FCM token: \(token ?? "nil")")
}

// APNs token (FCM handles this internally)
// Do NOT send raw APNs token to your server when using FCM
```

### Missing APNs Key in Firebase Console

**Symptom**: FCM works on Android, notifications not arriving on iOS

**Fix**:
1. Firebase Console → Project Settings → Cloud Messaging
2. Upload APNs Authentication Key (.p8)
3. Enter Key ID and Team ID
4. Verify bundle ID matches your app

## Quick Reference Table

| Symptom | Check | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| No notifications at all | Step 1: entitlements | Enable Push Notification capability, regenerate profile |
| Token registration fails | Step 2: callbacks | Implement both delegate methods in AppDelegate |
| 400 BadDeviceToken | Token format | Re-register; check hex encoding (no spaces, no angle brackets) |
| 403 InvalidProviderToken | JWT/certificate | Regenerate JWT; verify key ID, team ID, bundle ID |
| 410 Unregistered | Device state | App uninstalled or token rotated — remove from server |
| Works dev not prod | Step 3: curl both | Switch APNs endpoint; tokens differ per environment |
| Silent push ignored | Payload + headers | content-available: 1, push-type: background, priority: 5 |
| Rich media missing | Extension | Add mutable-content: 1, check extension bundle ID and timeout |
| Plain text though mutable-content set | NSE timeout | Call contentHandler in serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire fallback — otherwise the original content is delivered |
| Delivery unreliable / tempted to resend | Headers, not volume | apns-expiration (store-and-forward), apns-collapse-id (replace not stack) |
| Live Activity stale | Topic format | Use {bundleID}.push-type.liveactivity topic |
| Focus mode filtering | Interruption level | Use .timeSensitive for important notifications |
| FCM iOS failure | Firebase Console | Upload .p8 key with correct Key ID and Team ID |
| Actions not showing | Category ID | Match category identifier in payload to registered categories |

## Pressure Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "Server team says the problem is on the iOS side"

**Context**: Push notifications stopped working. The backend team says their payload is fine and the problem must be in the app.

**Pressure**: Skip client-side diagnostics and assume the server is right. Start rewriting notification handling code.

**Reality**: Entitlement and token problems (Steps 1-2) are client-side and are what to rule out first, not code bugs. The server may be sending to the wrong environment or using an expired token.

**Correct action**: Run all 4 mandatory diagnostic steps before touching code. Share the curl test (Step 3) results with the server team — this objectively proves which side has the issue.

**Push-back template**: "Let me verify the client-side chain first — I can share the curl results in 5 minutes so we both know exactly where the failure is."

### Scenario 2: "Notifications stopped after iOS update, ship a fix today"

**Context**: Users report notifications stopped working after updating to a new iOS version. Management wants a hotfix today.

**Pressure**: Start debugging notification code immediately. Assume Apple broke something.

**Reality**: New iOS versions often enable Focus mode by default or change interruption level filtering — a payload or Settings fix, with no code change needed on your side.

**Correct action**: Check Tree 6 ("Notifications stopped after iOS update"). Verify Focus mode settings on test devices before changing any code. If Focus is filtering, the fix is setting the correct `interruption-level` in the payload, not rewriting notification handling.

**Push-back template**: "iOS updates often change Focus mode defaults. Let me check interruption levels first — if that's the cause, the fix is a one-line payload change, not a code rewrite."

### Scenario 3: "Silent push worked last week, nothing changed"

**Context**: Background content sync via silent push stopped working. "We didn't change anything."

**Pressure**: Deep-dive into background execution code. Assume a regression.

**Reality**: Silent push has a system-enforced throttle budget (~2-3/hour). If usage increased, or if users force-quit the app, silent push stops working regardless of code quality. Also, the provisioning profile may have been regenerated without the push entitlement.

**Correct action**: Follow Tree 3 ("Silent notifications not waking app"). Check throttle budget, force-quit state, and entitlements before debugging code.

**Push-back template**: "Silent push has a system throttle budget. Let me verify we haven't exceeded it and that the app hasn't been force-quit on test devices — those are the two most common causes."

### Scenario 4: "Just send the push 50 times so it gets through" / "just poll"

**Context**: A notification didn't arrive (user was offline). The PM wants you to resend the same push 50 times to brute-force delivery, or to switch to polling the server every minute as a workaround.

**Pressure**: Take the volume shortcut. It "feels" more reliable and ships faster than understanding APNs headers.

**Reality**: Both are wrong fixes to a header problem. Resending stacks 50 banners and flags you for APNs abuse. Polling drains battery and gets rejected by App Review. APNs already does store-and-forward — the missing pieces are headers, not retries.

**Correct action**: Reach for the Delivery Levers. Set apns-expiration so APNs holds the push and delivers it when the offline device reconnects. Use apns-collapse-id so updates replace the previous banner instead of stacking. Set apns-priority by urgency. And on 410 Unregistered, delete the dead token server-side so you stop wasting sends.

**Push-back template**: "Sending it 50 times stacks 50 banners and risks abuse flagging — the real fix is two headers. apns-expiration tells APNs to store-and-forward to the offline device, and apns-collapse-id replaces the banner instead of stacking. That's reliable delivery without the spam."

## Checklist

Before escalating push notification issues:

- [ ] Push Notification capability enabled in Xcode (Step 1)
- [ ] Provisioning profile contains aps-environment (Step 1)
- [ ] Token registration callback fires with a hex device token (Step 2)
- [ ] curl to APNs returns HTTP/2 200 (Step 3)
- [ ] User authorized notifications, status = 2 (Step 4)
- [ ] APNs environment matches build type (sandbox/production)
- [ ] Focus mode not filtering notifications on test device
- [ ] Tested on a physical device (the Simulator registers against the APNs sandbox on Apple silicon, but `simctl push` covers only app notifications)
- [ ] For FCM: APNs auth key uploaded to Firebase Console
- [ ] For silent push: background mode enabled, priority 5, no alert keys
- [ ] For rich media: NSE bundle ID prefix matches host app, and serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire calls contentHandler so the attached media is delivered instead of dropped
- [ ] For unreliable delivery: use apns-expiration and apns-collapse-id, not resends or polling; delete 410 Unregistered tokens server-side
