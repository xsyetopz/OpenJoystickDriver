## Cross-Domain Routing

**Widget + data sync** (widget not showing updated data):
- Widget timeline not refreshing → **stay here** (extensions-widgets)
- SwiftData/Core Data not shared with extension → **also invoke axiom-data** (App Groups)

**App Intents + security** (lock-screen intent risk, prompt injection via Siri):
- Intent/schema API surface → **stay here** (app-intents-ref)
- Threat modeling, authenticationPolicy gating, schema risk metadata → **also invoke axiom-security** (skills/agentic-security.md)

**Live Activity + push notification**:
- ActivityKit push token / broadcast setup → **stay here** (live-activities)
- Push delivery failures → **also invoke axiom-networking** (networking-diag)
- Entitlements/certificates → **also invoke axiom-build**

**VoIP push + CallKit** (VoIP app killed / pushes stopped arriving):
- VoIP push must report a call — to CallKit **or** LiveCommunicationKit → **stay here** (callkit-livecommunicationkit, Part 1)
- PushKit token vs APNs delivery → **stay here** (push-notifications for the APNs contrast)
- Call audio silent/misrouted → **also invoke axiom-media** (AVAudioSession category)

**Push + background processing** (silent push not triggering background work):
- Push payload and delivery → **stay here** (push-notifications-diag)
- BGTaskScheduler execution → **stay here** (background-processing)

**In-game content** (StoreKit + Background Assets, Unity plug-ins):
- Asset packs, IAP mechanics, payment sheet, mock server → **stay here** (background-assets, in-app-purchases)
- Game input, rendering, game-side performance → **also invoke axiom-games / axiom-graphics**

**Calendar/Contacts + data sync**:
- EventKit/Contacts data issues → **stay here**
- Shared data with widget via App Groups → **also invoke axiom-data**

#### watchOS surfaces
- Complications + Smart Stack widgets → See axiom-watchos (skills/smart-stack-and-complications.md)
- Live Activities on Apple Watch → See axiom-watchos (skills/controls-and-live-activities.md)

## Conflict Resolution

**integration vs axiom-build**: When system features fail with entitlement/certificate errors:
- Use **axiom-build** for signing and provisioning issues
- Use **integration** for API usage and permission patterns

**integration vs axiom-data**: When widgets or extensions can't access shared data:
- App Groups and shared containers → **axiom-data**
- Specifically: GRDB/SQLite database shared with widget/extension/Live Activity → See axiom-data (skills/grdb-app-groups.md)
- Widget timeline, Live Activity updates → **integration**

**integration vs axiom-media**: When media features overlap with system features:
- Camera/photo/audio/haptics code → **axiom-media**
- Privacy manifests for camera/microphone → **stay here** (privacy-ux)
- Background audio mode → **stay here** (background-processing)

## Anti-Rationalization

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "App Intents are just a protocol conformance" | App Intents have parameter validation, entity queries, and background execution. |
| "Widgets are simple, I've done them before" | Widgets have timeline, interactivity, and Live Activity patterns that evolve yearly. |
| "Localization is just String Catalogs" | Xcode 26 has type-safe localization, generated symbols, and #bundle macro. |
| "Push notifications are just a payload and a token" | Token lifecycle, Focus levels, service extension gotchas cause 80% of push bugs. |
| "I'll just bundle the assets, it's simpler" | Bundling assets too large for the app bundle inflates first-install size and pays the cost every update. Background Assets ships with App Store install-progress integration; FM adapters can't be bundled at all. See `skills/background-assets.md`. |
| "I'll use URLSession for the asset download" | URLSession doesn't integrate with App Store install progress, charging-aware scheduling, or per-app quota — and can't reach Apple-hosted asset packs at all. Background Assets is the supported channel. |
| "On-Demand Resources still works fine" | The entire `NSBundleResourceRequest` family is deprecated in the 27 SDKs ("Use Background Assets instead"). Migrate ODR tags to asset packs. See `skills/background-assets.md`. |
| "Just request full Calendar access" | Most apps only need to add events — EventKitUI does that with zero permissions. |
| "SharePlay is just a message channel between participants" | `GroupSession` is not `Sendable`, observation is Combine-only, and the late-joiner delta depends on `@Published` willSet timing. Migrating it to `@Observable` silently breaks catch-up. |
| "The person who started the SharePlay session is the host" | There is no host. Every participant is equal — the framework has no owner or turn-taking concept. `lifetimePolicy` is the only related control, and it lives on the activity. |
| "One messenger, I'll pick reliable or unreliable per message" | `deliveryMode` is a `let` fixed at init and no `send` overload takes a mode. Mixed protocols need two `GroupSessionMessenger` instances. |
| "I'll request Bluetooth permission and scan for the accessory" | AccessorySetupKit (iOS 18+) pairs in one tap with no broad Bluetooth prompt and grants scoped BT+Wi-Fi access. See `skills/accessorysetupkit.md`. |
| "I'll process the VoIP push, then report the call when ready" | iOS terminates your app and stops delivering VoIP pushes if a push that required a report doesn't report a call — to CallKit or LiveCommunicationKit — *before* completion. From iOS 26.4 PushKit's metadata delegate exempts the pushes it hands you with `mustReport` `false`. Report first, fetch after. See `skills/callkit-livecommunicationkit.md`. |
| "No internet on this network, so I'll keep my own socket open in the background" | iOS suspends the app and the socket dies. Local Push Connectivity runs a system-managed provider extension for exactly this. See `skills/local-push-connectivity.md`. |
| "I'll activate the audio session when the call connects" | CallKit owns the audio session — activate only in `provider(_:didActivate:)` or audio is silent/misrouted. See `skills/callkit-livecommunicationkit.md`. |
| "I'll use CNContactStore directly for picking" | CNContactPickerViewController needs no authorization and shows all contacts. |
