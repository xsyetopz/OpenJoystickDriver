# Security & Credentials

**You MUST use this skill for ANY keychain, encryption, passkey, app integrity, agentic/AI feature security, file protection, or code signing work.**

## Conflict Resolution

**security vs axiom-build**: When build fails with signing errors:
- Code signing errors (certificate, profile, entitlement) → **use security**
- Environment issues (Xcode version, simulator, Derived Data) → **use axiom-build**
- If unsure, check the error message: `CODESIGN`, `ITMS-90xxx`, `errSec` → **security**

**security vs shipping**: When preparing for App Store:
- Privacy manifests, submission checklists, rejections → **use shipping**
- Code signing for distribution, certificate management → **use security**

**security vs axiom-data**: When storing sensitive data:
- Tokens, passwords, API keys → **use security** (keychain)
- User preferences, non-sensitive settings → **use axiom-data** (UserDefaults/SwiftData)
- File encryption levels for database files → **use security** (file-protection-ref)
- SQLite-specific Data Protection (`.db`/`-wal`/`-shm` trio, widget-while-locked access) → See axiom-data (skills/grdb-app-groups.md) §4

**security vs axiom-networking**: When securing network communication:
- TLS configuration, certificate pinning → **use axiom-networking**
- Signing API requests, encrypting payloads → **use security** (CryptoKit)

## Critical Patterns

**Keychain** (`skills/keychain.md`):
- SecItem mental model: uniqueness constraints, data protection classes
- Biometric access control (Face ID / Touch ID)
- Keychain sharing between app and extensions
- Background access pitfalls, Mac keychain differences
- Migration from UserDefaults/@AppStorage for sensitive data

**Keychain API** (`skills/keychain-ref.md`):
- SecItemAdd/CopyMatching/Update/Delete signatures
- Item class attributes, uniqueness constraint rules
- kSecAttrAccessible levels and when each applies
- Access control flags, biometric integration
- Complete error code reference

**Keychain Diagnostics** (`skills/keychain-diag.md`):
- errSecDuplicateItem from unexpected uniqueness constraints
- errSecItemNotFound despite item existing (query mismatch)
- errSecInteractionNotAllowed in background contexts
- Access group and entitlement mismatches
- Items disappearing after app updates

**CryptoKit** (`skills/cryptokit.md`):
- AES-GCM and ChaChaPoly authenticated encryption
- ECDSA/EdDSA digital signatures
- Secure Enclave hardware-backed keys
- Key agreement (ECDH) for end-to-end encryption
- HPKE for modern asymmetric encryption
- Post-quantum algorithms (ML-KEM, ML-DSA)
- CommonCrypto migration path

**CryptoKit API** (`skills/cryptokit-ref.md`):
- Hash functions (SHA-256/384/512, SHA-3), HMAC
- Symmetric encryption (AES-GCM, ChaChaPoly)
- Asymmetric signing (P256, P384, P521, Curve25519, Ed25519)
- Key agreement, key derivation (HKDF)
- Secure Enclave key creation and usage
- Swift Crypto cross-platform parity

**Passkeys** (`skills/passkeys.md`):
- ASAuthorizationController registration and assertion flows
- AutoFill-assisted requests (QuickType bar integration)
- Automatic passkey upgrades for existing users (iOS 18+)
- Combined credential requests (passkey + password + Sign in with Apple)
- Associated domains configuration for WebAuthn

**App Attest** (`skills/app-attest.md`):
- DCAppAttestService attestation and assertion flows
- Server-side validation of attestation objects
- macOS support + tampering signals (extensions, key access control) from the 27 cycle
- Fraud metric as an investigation signal
- DeviceCheck 2-bit per-device state
- Gradual rollout strategies for large install bases
- Handling unsupported devices gracefully

**Agentic Security** (`skills/agentic-security.md`):
- Threat modeling agentic features (indirect prompt injection, Lethal Trifecta)
- Deterministic vs probabilistic mitigations (redaction, spotlighting, confirmation, unlock gating)
- Foundation Models lifecycle modifiers (.onToolCall confirmation, .historyTransform)
- App Intents authenticationPolicy and schema risk metadata

**File Protection** (`skills/file-protection-ref.md`):
- NSFileProtection levels (complete, completeUnlessOpen, afterFirstUnlock, none)
- Hardware-accelerated encryption tied to device passcode
- Background file access requirements
- Keychain vs file protection comparison

**Code Signing** (`skills/code-signing.md`):
- Automatic vs manual signing tradeoffs
- Certificate and profile management across teams
- fastlane match for team-wide certificate sharing
- CI/CD signing setup (GitHub Actions, Xcode Cloud)
- Distribution build preparation (App Store, TestFlight, Ad Hoc)

**Code Signing Diagnostics** (`skills/code-signing-diag.md`):
- Certificate issues (expired, missing, wrong type, revoked)
- Provisioning profile issues (expired, missing cert, wrong App ID)
- Entitlement mismatches (capability in Xcode but not in profile)
- Keychain issues in CI (locked keychain, errSecInternalComponent)
- Archive/export failures (wrong export method, wrong cert type)

**Code Signing CLI** (`skills/code-signing-ref.md`):
- `security find-identity`, `security cms -D` for profile inspection
- `codesign -d --entitlements` for entitlement extraction
- Certificate types, validity periods, per-account limits
- fastlane match commands and Keychain management

## Automated Scanning

**Security audit** → Launch `security-privacy-scanner` agent (scans for hardcoded credentials, insecure token storage, Privacy Manifest coverage gaps, ATS violations, missing ATT descriptions, missing export compliance, weak Keychain ACLs, and compound rejection risks; scores posture HARDENED/GAPS/VULNERABLE)

## Anti-Rationalization

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "I'll store the token in UserDefaults for now" | UserDefaults is a plist file readable by any process with file access. Keychain takes 10 lines. `skills/keychain.md` shows the pattern. |
| "My app doesn't need encryption" | If you store any user data at rest, iOS file protection is free. `skills/file-protection-ref.md` covers protection levels. |
| "CommonCrypto works fine, no need to migrate" | CommonCrypto is C API with manual memory management and no compile-time safety. CryptoKit prevents buffer overflows and key misuse. |
| "I'll just use automatic signing" | Automatic signing works until CI, team scaling, or capability changes break it. Understand manual signing before you need it. `skills/code-signing.md` covers both. |
| "Passkeys are too new, passwords are fine" | Passkeys are phishing-resistant and supported since iOS 16. The migration path supports both simultaneously. `skills/passkeys.md` shows combined flows. |
| "I'll regenerate all certificates to fix this" | Regenerating revokes existing certs and breaks every teammate's build. Diagnose first. `skills/code-signing-diag.md` has the diagnostic flow. |
| "App Attest is overkill for my app" | If your app has any server-verified purchase, promotion, or competitive feature, tampered clients will exploit it. `skills/app-attest.md` covers gradual rollout. |
| "I'll use @unchecked Sendable on my crypto wrapper" | Hiding thread-safety issues from the compiler in security code is how data corruption happens. See axiom-concurrency for safe patterns. |
| "kSecAttrAccessibleAlways is fine" | Deprecated since iOS 12. Items are accessible even when device is locked and unencrypted during backup. Use kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlock at minimum. |
| "Prompt injection won't hit our little AI feature" | Any external content reaching your model (a calendar invite, a feed post) is the attack surface, and the model picks the actions. `skills/agentic-security.md` has the threat model and the deterministic mitigations. |
