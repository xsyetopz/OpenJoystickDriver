# Accessibility

**You MUST use this skill for ANY accessibility work including VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, color contrast, WCAG compliance, and UX flow auditing.**

<!-- AXIOM_AUDITOR_INLINE_BEGIN — auto-maintained by scripts/build-inlined-auditors.ts; do not hand-edit -->
> **Not on Claude Code?** Where this router says "Launch `some-auditor` agent", read that auditor's file in this suite and follow it inline — the same procedure, needing only file search and read.

> Agents that need Bash — builds, tests, simulators, crash symbolication — stay Claude Code-only; there is no inline equivalent for those.

## Cross-Suite Routes

- Full watchOS development context → See axiom-watchos
- Live accessibility validation on the simulator (set toggles, assert announcements) → `simulator-tester` agent + `xcui` — see axiom-tools (skills/xcui-ref.md)
- Asserting VoiceOver speech in an XCUITest (`XCUIDevice.shared.voiceOverService`, `OS27`) → axiom-testing (skills/ui-testing.md Pattern 7)

## Decision Tree

```dot
digraph accessibility {
    start [label="Accessibility issue" shape=ellipse];
    what [label="What type?" shape=diamond];

    start -> what;
    what -> "skills/accessibility-diag.md" [label="VoiceOver/labels/hints"];
    what -> "skills/accessibility-diag.md" [label="Dynamic Type"];
    what -> "skills/accessibility-diag.md" [label="color contrast"];
    what -> "skills/accessibility-diag.md" [label="touch targets"];
    what -> "skills/accessibility-diag.md" [label="keyboard nav"];
    what -> "skills/accessibility-diag.md" [label="resizable window / desktop-class"];
    what -> "skills/accessibility-diag.md" [label="Reduce Motion"];
    what -> "skills/accessibility-diag.md" [label="Assistive Access"];
    what -> "skills/accessibility-diag.md" [label="custom control techniques"];
    what -> "skills/accessibility-diag.md" [label="continuous reading / text navigation"];
    what -> "skills/accessibility-diag.md" [label="captions / subtitle styling"];
    what -> "skills/accessibility-diag.md" [label="App Store prep / Nutrition Labels"];
    what -> "skills/ux-flow-audit.md" [label="UX dead end/dismiss trap"];
    what -> "skills/ux-flow-audit.md" [label="missing states"];
    what -> "skills/watchos-a11y.md" [label="watchOS VoiceOver / AssistiveTouch / Double Tap"];
    what -> "accessibility-auditor" [label="automated scan" shape=box];
}
```

1. ANY VoiceOver, Dynamic Type (including tvOS Large Text), contrast, touch target, or WCAG issue → `skills/accessibility-diag.md`
2. Assistive Access (cognitive disabilities, iOS 17+) → `skills/accessibility-diag.md`
3. App Store accessibility rejection or Nutrition Labels → `skills/accessibility-diag.md`
4. Reading app: VoiceOver stops at paragraphs/pages, Speak Screen halts → `skills/accessibility-diag.md`
5. UX dead ends, dismiss traps, buried CTAs, missing states → `skills/ux-flow-audit.md`
6. watchOS-specific accessibility (rotor on Digital Crown, AssistiveTouch, Double Tap) → `skills/watchos-a11y.md`
7. Want automated accessibility scan? → `accessibility-auditor` agent or `/axiom:audit accessibility`

## Automated Scanning

**Accessibility audit** → Launch `accessibility-auditor` agent or `/axiom:audit accessibility`
- VoiceOver labels and hints
- Dynamic Type violations
- Color contrast failures
- WCAG compliance scanning

**UX flow audit** → Launch `ux-flow-auditor` agent
- Dead-end views, dismiss traps
- Buried CTAs, missing empty/loading/error states
- Deep link dead ends, accessibility dead ends

## Critical Patterns

#### Image Accessibility

- Use `Image(decorative: "photo")` for purely decorative images — automatically hidden from VoiceOver (equivalent to `accessibilityHidden(true)` but semantically clearer)
- Use `accessibilityInputLabels()` for buttons with complex or changing labels — improves Voice Control accuracy by providing alternative labels
- Respect `accessibilityDifferentiateWithoutColor` environment value — when active, provide non-color cues (icons, patterns, labels) alongside color indicators

## Anti-Rationalization

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "I'll add VoiceOver labels when I'm done building" | Accessibility is foundational, not polish. accessibility-diag prevents App Store rejection. |
| "My app doesn't need accessibility" | All apps need accessibility. It's required by App Store guidelines and benefits all users. |
| "Dynamic Type just needs .scaledFont" | Dynamic Type has 7 common violations. accessibility-diag catches them all. |
| "Color contrast looks fine to me" | Visual assessment is unreliable. WCAG ratios require measurement. accessibility-diag validates. |
| "UX issues are just polish" | UX dead ends cause 1-star reviews. They're defects, not enhancements. |
| "The dismiss gesture handles it" | fullScreenCover has no dismiss gesture. That's the trap. |
