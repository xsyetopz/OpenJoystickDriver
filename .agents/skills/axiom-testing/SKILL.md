# Testing

**You MUST use this skill for ANY testing-related question, including writing tests, debugging test failures, making tests faster, or choosing between testing approaches.**

## Decision Tree

```dot
digraph testing {
    start [label="Testing task" shape=ellipse];
    what [label="What kind of test?" shape=diamond];

    start -> what;
    what -> "skills/swift-testing.md" [label="unit tests,\nSwift Testing,\nfast tests"];
    what -> "skills/testing-async.md" [label="testing async code,\ncallbacks,\nconfirmation"];
    what -> "skills/ui-testing.md" [label="UI tests,\nflaky tests,\nrecording"];
    what -> "skills/xctest-automation.md" [label="XCUITest patterns,\nelement queries"];
    what -> "skills/ui-recording.md" [label="Xcode 26\nRecord/Replay/Review"];
    what -> "axiom-ai (skills/foundation-models-evaluations.md)" [label="generative AI feature\n(nondeterministic output)"];
}
```

1. Writing unit tests / Swift Testing? → `skills/swift-testing.md`
2. Testing async/await code? → `skills/testing-async.md`
3. Writing UI tests / XCUITest / flaky tests? → `skills/ui-testing.md`
4. XCUIElement queries, waiting, test plans, CI? → `skills/xctest-automation.md`
5. Record UI interactions (Xcode 26)? → `skills/ui-recording.md`
6. Flaky tests / race conditions (Swift Testing)? → test-failure-analyzer (Agent)
7. Tests crash / environment wrong? → See axiom-build (skills/xcode-debugging.md)
8. Run tests from CLI / parse results? → test-runner (Agent)
9. Fix failing tests automatically? → test-debugger (Agent)
10. Want test quality audit? → testing-auditor (Agent) or `/axiom:audit testing`
11. Automate without XCUITest / AXe CLI? → simulator-tester (Agent) + See axiom-xcode-mcp (skills/axe-ref.md)
12. Testing a Foundation Models / generative feature? → See axiom-ai (`skills/foundation-models-evaluations.md`) for the discipline (dataset design, guardrails vs optimization target, judge calibration), then axiom-ai (`skills/foundation-models-evaluations-ref.md`) for the API. The Evaluations framework (`OS27`) runs *inside* Swift Testing via the `.evaluates` trait — it doesn't replace it. A model isn't a pure function, so you score outputs against a dataset and gate on an aggregate metric instead of asserting on one exact string.

## Swift Testing vs XCTest Quick Guide

| Need | Use |
|------|-----|
| Unit tests (logic, models) | Swift Testing |
| UI tests (tap, swipe, assert screens) | XCUITest (XCTest) |
| Tests without simulator | Package/Framework (either framework) |
| Parameterized tests | Swift Testing |
| Performance measurements | XCTest (XCTMetric) |
| Objective-C tests | XCTest |

## Critical Patterns

**Swift Testing** (`skills/swift-testing.md`):
- @Test/@Suite macros, #expect/#require assertions
- Parameterized testing for eliminating repetitive tests
- Fast tests architecture: Package extraction, Host Application: None
- Reliable async testing with withMainSerialExecutor and TestClock
- Migration guide from XCTest (comparison table)
- XCTestCase + Swift 6.2 MainActor compatibility fix

**Async Testing** (`skills/testing-async.md`):
- confirmation for single/multiple callbacks
- expectedCount: 0 to verify something never happens
- @MainActor test isolation
- Timeout control with .timeLimit
- Parallel execution gotchas and .serialized

**UI Testing** (`skills/ui-testing.md`):
- Condition-based waiting (replaces sleep())
- Recording UI Automation (Xcode 26)
- Network conditioning for 3G/LTE testing
- Multi-factor testing (device size + network speed)
- Crash debugging from UI test failures

**XCUITest Automation** (`skills/xctest-automation.md`):
- Element identification with accessibilityIdentifier
- Waiting strategies (appear, disappear, hittable)
- Test plans for multi-configuration testing
- CI/CD integration with parallel execution

**UI Recording** (`skills/ui-recording.md`):
- Xcode 26 Record/Replay/Review workflow
- Enhancing recorded code for stability
- Query selection guidelines
- Test plan configuration for multi-language replay

## Automated Scanning

**Test quality audit** → Launch `testing-auditor` agent or `/axiom:audit testing` (maps test coverage shape against production code, detects flaky patterns and speed issues, identifies untested critical paths, scores overall test health)

**Flaky test analysis** → Launch `test-failure-analyzer` agent (scans for patterns causing intermittent failures in Swift Testing: missing confirmation, shared mutable state, missing @MainActor)

## Anti-Rationalization

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Simple test question, I don't need the skill" | Proper patterns prevent test debt. `skills/swift-testing.md` has copy-paste solutions. |
| "I know XCTest well enough" | Swift Testing is significantly better for unit tests. Migration guide included. |
| "Tests are slow but it's fine" | Fast tests enable TDD. `skills/swift-testing.md` shows how to run without simulator. |
| "I'll fix the flaky test with a sleep()" | sleep() makes tests slower AND flakier. `skills/ui-testing.md` has condition-based waiting. |
| "I'll add tests later" | Tests written after implementation miss edge cases. |
| "I'll test the AI feature by asserting the model returns the right string" | A model isn't a pure function — that test fails on a synonym and passes on a fluent lie. Score a dataset and gate on an aggregate metric: axiom-ai (`skills/foundation-models-evaluations.md`). |
| "The AI output looked good when I tried it, so it's tested" | Trying a few prompts by hand measures nothing and catches no regression. That's the exact gap the Evaluations framework exists to close. |
