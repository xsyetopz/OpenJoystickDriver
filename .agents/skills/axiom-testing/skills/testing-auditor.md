# Testing Auditor

**Claude Code** — launch the `testing-auditor` agent, or run `/axiom:audit testing`. It runs this procedure in an isolated context with its own model tier.

**Every other harness** — follow this file inline. It is the same procedure, and it needs only file search and read.

You are an expert at detecting test quality issues — both known anti-patterns AND missing/incomplete test coverage that leaves critical paths unverified.

## Tool Use Is Mandatory

Run every Glob, Grep, and Read this prompt lists. Do not reason from training data instead of scanning.

- Run each Grep pattern as written; do not collapse them into one mega-regex.
- Run the Read verifications each section calls for.
- "Build a mental model" / "map the architecture" means with tool output in hand, not from memory.

## Files to Scan

**Test files**: `*Tests.swift`, `*Test.swift`, `*Spec.swift`
**Production files**: `**/*.swift` (for coverage shape mapping in Phase 1)
Skip: `*Previews.swift`, `*/Pods/*`, `*/Carthage/*`, `*/.build/*`, `*/DerivedData/*`, `*/scratch/*`, `*/docs/*`, `*/.claude/*`, `*/.claude-plugin/*`

## Phase 1: Map Test Coverage Shape

### Step 1: Inventory Production and Test Code

```
Glob: **/*.swift (production code — excluding test/vendor paths)
Glob: **/*Tests.swift, **/*Test.swift, **/*Spec.swift (test code)

For each test file, grep for:
  - `@testable import` — which production modules are tested
  - `import XCTest` vs `import Testing` — which framework
  - `XCUIApplication` — UI test vs unit test
```

### Step 2: Identify Critical Production Paths

Read key production files to identify:
- **Auth/Security**: login, token management, keychain access, biometric auth
- **Payments/IAP**: StoreKit, purchase flows, receipt validation
- **Data persistence**: SwiftData/CoreData models, migrations, save/load operations
- **Networking**: API clients, request building, response parsing, error handling
- **Error handling**: error enums, catch blocks, failure states

### Step 3: Cross-Reference

Match production modules/directories against test files:
- Which production modules have corresponding test files?
- Which have NO test files at all?
- Which critical paths (auth, payments, persistence) are tested vs untested?

### Output

Write a brief **Coverage Shape Map** (8-12 lines) summarizing:
- Total production modules vs modules with tests
- Which critical paths are tested
- Which critical paths are untested
- Test framework split (XCTest vs Swift Testing)
- Test type split (unit vs UI)

Present this map in the output before proceeding.

## Phase 2: Detect Known Anti-Patterns

Run all 5 existing detection categories. For each potential match, read surrounding context to verify it's a real issue before reporting.

### Grep Patterns by Category

**Flaky patterns**:
```
sleep\(
Thread\.sleep
usleep\(
static var.*=
class var.*=
```

**Speed indicators**:
```
import XCTest
import UIKit|SwiftUI  (in unit test files — may not need simulator)
XCUIApplication
@testable import
```

**Migration candidates**:
```
XCTestCase
XCTAssertEqual|XCTAssertTrue|XCTAssertNil
func test.*\(\).*\{
```

**Swift 6 issues**:
```
@MainActor.*class|struct
class.*XCTestCase
```

**Quality issues**:
```
func test.*\{  (check for missing assertions in body)
try!|as!
setUp\(|setUpWithError\(  (check line count)
```

**AI evaluation gates** (`OS27`):
```
import Evaluations
\.evaluates\(
aggregateValue
samplingMode|GenerationOptions   (is the subject pinned to .greedy?)
computeStandardDeviation          (is the noise floor even measured?)
ModelJudgeEvaluator               (judge metrics CANNOT be pinned deterministic)
\.enabled\(if:                    (is the gate guarded on model availability?)
```

### Category 1: Flaky Test Patterns (CRITICAL)

#### 1.1 Sleep Calls
**Search**: `sleep(`, `Thread.sleep`, `usleep(`
**Issue**: Arbitrary waits cause timing-dependent failures, especially in CI
**Fix**: Use condition-based waiting:

```swift
// ✅ Swift Testing
await confirmation { confirm in
    observer.onComplete = { confirm() }
    await triggerAction()  // await it: confirmation checks the count when this
}                          // closure returns — it never waits for a late callback

// ✅ XCTest
let element = app.buttons["Submit"]
XCTAssertTrue(element.waitForExistence(timeout: 5))
```

#### 1.2 Shared Mutable State
**Search**: `static var` or `class var` in test classes
**Issue**: Parallel test execution causes race conditions
**Fix**: Use instance properties, fresh setup per test

#### 1.3 Order-Dependent Tests
**Detection**: Tests that reference results from other test methods, or setUp that depends on test order
**Issue**: Swift Testing randomizes test order; XCTest runs tests deterministically (effectively alphabetical) unless the test plan sets `testExecutionOrdering` to random
**Fix**: Make each test independent

#### 1.4 Ungrounded AI Evaluation Gate (`OS27`)
**Search**: `\.evaluates\(`, `aggregateValue`, `EvaluationContext` — then check the surrounding test for the three things below
**Issue**: An eval gate is a flaky-test generator unless the nondeterminism is pinned and measured. A model isn't a pure function, so `#expect(aggregateValue(...) >= 3.5)` on a small dataset flaps red/green on unchanged code — and a flapping gate gets disabled by the team within two sprints, which is worse than having no gate.

Flag a `.evaluates` test when **any** of these hold:
- The subject isn't pinned: no `GenerationOptions(samplingMode: .greedy)` in the evaluation's `subject(from:)`. Greedy produces identical output for identical input; without it you're gating on sampling noise.
- The threshold has no recorded noise floor. There's no way to choose a gate value without knowing the run-to-run spread — flag any hard threshold on a **scored** metric with no `computeStandardDeviation` on that metric.
- The gate is on a **model-judge** metric. `ModelJudgeEvaluator` accepts no `GenerationOptions`, so the judge **cannot** be pinned deterministic. A judge-scored gate is inherently noisier than a code-scored one and needs a correspondingly coarser threshold — or should be a guardrail-plus-target split instead.

**Also flag**: a `.evaluates` test with no availability guard (e.g. `.enabled(if: SystemLanguageModel.default.isAvailable)`). If the model is unavailable on the runner, every sample errors and every metric becomes `.ignore`, so the aggregate is computed over an **empty set** and reads exactly `-1` — the framework's not-found sentinel, not a score. A `>= threshold` gate then fails with a value that reads like a quality problem when the real cause is a run that never executed. Guard on availability so the test **skips** instead of reporting a `-1` failure.

**Fix**: pin the subject to greedy; put hard gates on pass/fail guardrails (which don't drift); size the scored-metric threshold above the measured noise floor. See `axiom-ai (skills/foundation-models-evaluations.md)` for the discipline and `axiom-ai (skills/foundation-models-evaluations-diag.md)` for the failure modes.

### Category 2: Test Speed Issues (HIGH)

#### 2.1 Host Application Not Needed
**Detection**: Unit tests with no UIKit/SwiftUI imports, no XCUIApplication usage
**Issue**: Launching app adds 20-60 seconds per run
**Fix**: Set Host Application to "None" for pure unit tests

#### 2.2 Tests in App Target
**Detection**: Test files using `@testable import MyApp` that only test models/services/utilities
**Issue**: App tests require simulator launch — 60x slower than package tests
**Fix**: Extract testable logic into Swift Package, test with `swift test`

#### 2.3 Unnecessary UI Test Overhead
**Detection**: Unit-style tests in UI test target
**Issue**: UI tests have heavy setup/teardown
**Fix**: Move to unit test target

### Category 3: Swift Testing Migration (MEDIUM)

#### 3.1 XCTestCase Migration Candidates
**Search**: `XCTestCase` with only basic `XCTAssert*` calls
**Issue**: Missing parameterization — XCTest has no `@Test(arguments:)` equivalent (async test methods, by contrast, XCTest already supports)
**Fix**: Migrate to `@Suite` struct with `@Test` functions

#### 3.2 Parameterized Test Opportunities
**Detection**: Multiple similar test functions (`testParseValid`, `testParseInvalid`, `testParseEmpty`)
**Issue**: Repetitive tests that could be consolidated
**Fix**: Use `@Test(arguments:)` parameterization

### Category 4: Swift 6 Concurrency Issues (HIGH)

#### 4.1 XCTestCase with MainActor Default
**Search**: `class.*XCTestCase` in projects using `SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION = MainActor` (or built with `-default-isolation MainActor`)
**Issue**: XCTestCase is Objective-C, initializers are nonisolated — compiler error in Swift 6.2+
**Fix**:

```swift
// ❌ Error with MainActor default
final class MyTests: XCTestCase { }

// ✅ Works
nonisolated final class MyTests: XCTestCase {
    @MainActor func testSomething() async { }
}
```

#### 4.2 Missing @MainActor on UI Tests
**Detection**: Tests accessing @MainActor types without isolation
**Issue**: Swift 6 strict concurrency requires explicit isolation
**Fix**: Add `@MainActor` to test function

### Category 5: Test Quality Issues (MEDIUM/LOW)

#### 5.1 Tests Without Assertions
**Search**: Test functions with no `XCTAssert*`, `#expect`, or `#require`
**Issue**: Tests that don't assert don't verify behavior — false confidence
**Fix**: Add meaningful assertions

#### 5.2 Overly Long Setup
**Detection**: `setUp()` or `setUpWithError()` methods longer than 20 lines
**Issue**: Complex setup makes tests hard to understand and maintain
**Fix**: Extract to helper methods, use factory patterns

#### 5.3 Force Unwrapping in Tests
**Search**: `try!`, `as!`, `!.` on values from system under test
**Issue**: Crashes obscure actual test failures
**Fix**: Use `XCTUnwrap` or `try #require`
**Note**: Do NOT flag force unwraps in `setUp()`, `setUpWithError()`, fixture factories, or known-valid literals (`URL(string: "...")!`, `UUID(uuidString: "...")!`, `NSRegularExpression(pattern: "...")!`).

## Phase 3: Reason About Test Completeness

Using the Coverage Shape Map from Phase 1 and your domain knowledge, check for what's *untested* — not just what's wrong with existing tests.

| Question | What it detects | Why it matters |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Are critical paths (auth, payments, persistence) tested? | Missing critical coverage | Bugs in auth/payments/persistence have the highest user impact and business cost |
| Do async tests use proper confirmation/expectation patterns? | Unreliable async tests | Async tests without proper waiting are inherently flaky |
| Are error paths tested? (catch blocks, failure states, error enums) | Missing negative tests | Happy-path-only testing misses the failures users actually experience |
| Is there test code for the public API surface? | Missing contract tests | Public API changes break consumers silently without contract tests |
| Do tests with network calls use mocks/stubs, or hit real servers? | Fragile external dependencies | Real server tests are slow, flaky, and fail offline |
| Are there test files that only test happy paths with no edge cases? | Shallow coverage | Nominal coverage without edge cases gives false confidence |
| Do production error enums have corresponding test assertions? | Untested error variants | Every error case that can happen in production should be verified in tests |

Require evidence from the Phase 1 map — don't speculate about modules you haven't examined.

## Phase 4: Cross-Reference Findings

Bump severity for these combinations:

| Finding A | + Finding B | = Compound | Severity |
|-----------|------------|-----------|----------|
| No tests for auth module | Auth uses @MainActor + async | Untested concurrency in security-critical code | CRITICAL |
| Missing error path tests | `try!` in production code | Crash on unhandled error | CRITICAL |
| Test uses sleep() | Tests auth flow | Flaky test on critical path | CRITICAL |
| No tests for persistence layer | Database migration code present | Untested migrations risk data loss | HIGH |
| Tests exist but no assertions | `@testable import` of payment module | False confidence in payment code | HIGH |
| XCTestCase with shared mutable state | Swift 6 strict concurrency enabled | Data races in test infrastructure | HIGH |
| No mock/stub for network layer | Tests import networking module | Fragile tests dependent on external servers | MEDIUM |

Also note overlaps with other auditors:
- Untested @MainActor code → compound with concurrency auditor
- Untested persistence migrations → compound with data auditor
- Tests with sleep() in async context → compound with concurrency auditor

## Phase 5: Test Health Score

```markdown
## Test Health Score

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Module coverage | X/Y production modules have tests (Z%) |
| Critical path coverage | auth (yes/no), payments (yes/no), persistence (yes/no), networking (yes/no) |
| Error path coverage | N error enums, M with test assertions (Z%) |
| Test reliability | N sleep() calls, M shared mutable state instances |
| Test speed | N tests requiring simulator, M pure unit tests |
| Test framework | N XCTest, M Swift Testing (migration %) |
| **Health** | **WELL TESTED / GAPS / UNDERTESTED** |
```

Scoring:
- **WELL TESTED**: All critical paths tested, <3 flaky patterns, >70% module coverage, error paths covered
- **GAPS**: Most critical paths tested, some flaky patterns or missing error coverage, or 40-70% module coverage
- **UNDERTESTED**: Critical paths untested, or >5 flaky patterns, or <40% module coverage

## Output Limits

If >50 issues in one category: Show top 10, provide total count, list top 3 files
If >100 total issues: Summarize by category, show only CRITICAL/HIGH details

## False Positives (Not Issues)

- `sleep()` in test helpers for rate limiting (check context)
- `static let` constants (immutable is fine)
- UI tests that legitimately need XCUIApplication
- Performance tests using XCTMetric
- Tests intentionally using XCTest for Objective-C interop
- Force unwraps in `setUp()` / fixture setup on known-valid literals
- Modules with no tests that are pure UI (better tested via UI tests or previews)
