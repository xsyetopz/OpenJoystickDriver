# Data & Persistence

**You MUST use this skill for ANY data persistence, database, storage, CloudKit, or serialization work.**

<!-- AXIOM_AUDITOR_INLINE_BEGIN — auto-maintained by scripts/build-inlined-auditors.ts; do not hand-edit -->
> **Not on Claude Code?** Where this router says "Launch `some-auditor` agent", read that auditor's file in this suite and follow it inline — the same procedure, needing only file search and read.

> Agents that need Bash — builds, tests, simulators, crash symbolication — stay Claude Code-only; there is no inline equivalent for those.

## When to Use

Use this skill when working with:
- Databases (SwiftData, Core Data, GRDB, SQLiteData)
- Schema migrations
- CloudKit sync
- File storage (iCloud Drive, local storage)
- Data serialization (Codable, JSON)
- Storage strategy decisions
- Keychain / secure credential storage
- Encryption, signing, key management (CryptoKit)

### Automated Scanning

**Core Data audit** → Launch `core-data-auditor` agent or `/axiom:audit core-data` (safety violations, architectural gaps — migration options, thread-confinement, N+1 queries, merge policies, context isolation)
**Codable audit** → Launch `codable-auditor` agent or `/axiom:audit codable` (safety violations, semantic gaps — try? swallowing errors, JSONSerialization, date handling, silent field drops, wrapper-hidden fallbacks, cross-file strategy drift, enum future-case crashes)
**iCloud audit** → Launch `icloud-auditor` agent or `/axiom:audit icloud` (entitlement checks, file coordination, incomplete CKError matrix coverage, missing account-change observation, polling vs CKSubscriptions, SwiftData + CloudKit unsupported features, compound risks like uncoordinated I/O across extensions)
**Storage audit** → Launch `storage-auditor` agent or `/axiom:audit storage` (wrong file locations, missing backup exclusions, sensitive data on disk vs Keychain, missing App Group containers, unbounded cache growth, orphan files, compound risks like user data in tmp/ + critical content)
**Database schema audit** → Launch `database-schema-auditor` agent or `/axiom:audit database-schema` (unsafe ALTER TABLE, DROP operations, missing idempotency, FK constraints declared but not enforced, incomplete upgrade paths, compound risks like INSERT OR REPLACE on FK-referenced tables)
**GRDB performance audit** → Launch `grdb-performance-auditor` agent or `/axiom:audit grdb-performance` (raw SQL string interpolation, missing FK indexes in raw SQL, missing PRAGMA optimize for raw-GRDB apps, journal mode mismatch for app-group DBs, missing observesSuspensionNotifications for shared DBs, prefix-redundant indexes in raw SQL, legacy Record subclass, INSERT OR REPLACE misused as upsert, observation on WITHOUT ROWID tables, WITHOUT ROWID upsert bugs)
**SwiftData audit** → Launch `swiftdata-auditor` agent or `/axiom:audit swiftdata` (struct models, missing schema registration, array relationships without defaults, background context misuse, N+1 patterns, stale predicates, CloudKit conformance gaps, compound risks like struct model + array relationship)

## Anti-Rationalization

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Just adding a column, no migration needed" | Schema changes without migration crash users. database-migration prevents data loss. |
| "I'll handle the migration manually" | Manual migrations miss edge cases. database-migration has the safe additive patterns and both migration paths to test. |
| "Simple query, I don't need the skill" | Query patterns prevent N+1 and thread-safety issues. The skill has copy-paste solutions. |
| "CloudKit sync is straightforward" | CloudKit has 15+ failure modes. cloud-sync-diag diagnoses them systematically. |
| "I know Codable well enough" | Codable has silent data loss traps (try? swallows errors). codable skill prevents production bugs. |
| "@Shared is just @AppStorage with extra steps" | Mutation goes through `$shared.withLock`; the plain setter is deprecated, and below Sharing 2.8 on Swift 6.3 it is a compile error wherever a SwiftUI binding is chained into shared state. swift-sharing has the migration. |
| "I'll use local storage on tvOS" | No local directory on tvOS is guaranteed to survive between launches — the system purges them, Caches first. See axiom-swift (skills/tvos.md) for the iCloud-first pattern. |
| "UserDefaults is fine for this token" | UserDefaults is unencrypted, backed up to iCloud, and visible to MDM profiles. One audit catches it. keychain stores tokens securely. |
| "I'll encrypt it myself with CommonCrypto" | CryptoKit replaced CommonCrypto's buffer-management nightmares with one-line APIs. cryptokit prevents misuse. |

## Critical Pattern: Migrations

**ALWAYS read `skills/database-migration.md` when adding/modifying database columns.**

This prevents:
- "FOREIGN KEY constraint failed" errors
- "no such column" crashes
- Data loss from unsafe migrations
