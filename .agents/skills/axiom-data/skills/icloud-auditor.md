# iCloud Auditor

**Claude Code** — launch the `icloud-auditor` agent, or run `/axiom:audit icloud`. It runs this procedure in an isolated context with its own model tier.

**Every other harness** — follow this file inline. It is the same procedure, and it needs only file search and read.

You are an expert at detecting iCloud integration mistakes — both known anti-patterns AND missing/incomplete patterns that cause sync failures, data corruption, conflict loss, and silent CloudKit errors.

## Tool Use Is Mandatory

Run every Glob, Grep, and Read this prompt lists. Do not reason from training data instead of scanning.

- Run each Grep pattern as written; do not collapse them into one mega-regex.
- Run the Read verifications each section calls for.
- "Build a mental model" / "map the architecture" means with tool output in hand, not from memory.

## Files to Exclude

Skip: `*Tests.swift`, `*Previews.swift`, `*/Pods/*`, `*/Carthage/*`, `*/.build/*`, `*/DerivedData/*`, `*/scratch/*`, `*/docs/*`, `*/.claude/*`, `*/.claude-plugin/*`

## Phase 1: Map iCloud Surface in Use

### Step 1: Identify iCloud Subsystems

```
Glob: **/*.swift, **/*.entitlements, **/Info.plist (excluding test/vendor paths)
Grep for:
  - `import CloudKit` — CloudKit usage
  - `CKContainer`, `CKDatabase` — CloudKit DB references
  - `CKSyncEngine` — modern sync (iOS 17+)
  - `ubiquityContainerIdentifier`, `forUbiquityContainerIdentifier` — iCloud Drive
  - `NSMetadataQuery` — file presence/state queries
  - `NSFileCoordinator` — coordinated I/O on ubiquitous files
  - `NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore` — small-data KV sync
  - `cloudKitDatabase:` — SwiftData + CloudKit binding
  - `com\.apple\.developer\.icloud-`, `com\.apple\.developer\.ubiquity-` — entitlement keys
```

### Step 2: Identify Account & Availability Surface

```
Grep for:
  - `ubiquityIdentityToken` — iCloud sign-in checks
  - `accountStatus()` — CloudKit auth state
  - `NSUbiquityIdentityDidChange` — account change notification
  - `CKAccountChanged` — CloudKit account change
```

### Step 3: Identify Error & Conflict Handling Surface

```
Grep for:
  - `CKError` — error type usage
  - `error.code ==` or `case .quotaExceeded`, `.networkUnavailable`, `.serverRecordChanged`, `.notAuthenticated`, `.zoneNotFound`, `.partialFailure`
  - `ubiquitousItemHasUnresolvedConflicts` — iCloud Drive conflict detection
  - `NSFileVersion` — version-based conflict resolution
  - `CKSubscription` — push-based change notifications
```

### Step 4: Read Key Integration Files

Read 2-3 representative files (CloudKitManager / iCloud sync service / DocumentManager / any @Model with cloudKitDatabase config) to understand:
- Which CloudKit operations exist (save, fetch, modify, subscribe)
- Where availability checks live (once at launch vs every access)
- Whether error handling is centralized or per-call-site
- Whether the app uses CKSyncEngine or hand-rolled fetch/sync logic

### Output

Write a brief **iCloud Map** (5-10 lines) summarizing:
- Subsystems in use (CloudKit private/shared/public, iCloud Drive, NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore, SwiftData+CloudKit)
- Sync engine type (CKSyncEngine / legacy CKDatabase / pure iCloud Drive / KV-store)
- Where availability is checked (per-access / once / never)
- Error-handling pattern (centralized / per-call / missing)
- Account-change observation (yes / no)
- Number of `cloudKitDatabase:` SwiftData models, if any

Present this map in the output before proceeding.

## Phase 2: Detect Known Anti-Patterns

Run all 8 detection patterns. For every grep match, use Read to verify the surrounding context before reporting — grep patterns have high recall but need contextual verification.

### Pattern 1: Missing NSFileCoordinator on Ubiquitous I/O (CRITICAL/HIGH)

**Issue**: Reading or writing iCloud Drive files without `NSFileCoordinator` races with the sync daemon → corruption, lost updates, partial reads.
**Search**:
- `forUbiquityContainerIdentifier`
- `ubiquityContainerIdentifier`
- `NSMetadataQuery` (often paired with ubiquitous URLs)
**Verify**: Read matching files; check for `NSFileCoordinator` calls in the same I/O path. Direct `Data(contentsOf:)` or `data.write(to:)` on an ubiquitous URL is the bug.
**Fix**: Wrap reads/writes in `NSFileCoordinator().coordinate(readingItemAt:...)` or `coordinate(writingItemAt:options:.forReplacing,...)`.

### Pattern 2: Missing CloudKit Error Handling (HIGH/HIGH)

**Issue**: CloudKit operations without `CKError` handling silently fail. Critical paths (quota, network, conflict, auth) need explicit branches.
**Search**:
- `database\.save\(`, `database\.fetch`, `CKDatabase`, `CKRecord`
- Operation classes: `CKModifyRecordsOperation`, `CKFetchRecordZoneChangesOperation`
**Verify**: Read matching files; check for a `do/catch` around the call and a switch on `CKError.code`.
**Required branches**: `.quotaExceeded`, `.networkUnavailable`, `.serverRecordChanged`, `.notAuthenticated`.
**Fix**: Wrap in `do/catch let error as CKError`, switch on `error.code`, handle each code with the appropriate UX (storage prompt, retry queue, conflict merge, sign-in prompt).

### Pattern 3: Missing Entitlement / Availability Checks (HIGH/HIGH)

**Issue**: Touching ubiquitous container or CloudKit when the user is signed out crashes or returns silently invalid data.
**Search**:
- `ubiquityIdentityToken` — should appear before iCloud Drive access
- `accountStatus()` — should appear before CloudKit access
**Verify**: Read matching files; confirm a check guards every entry path, not just one.
**Fix**: `guard FileManager.default.ubiquityIdentityToken != nil else { ... }` for iCloud Drive; `await CKContainer.default().accountStatus()` returning `.available` for CloudKit.

### Pattern 4: SwiftData + CloudKit Unsupported Features (HIGH/MEDIUM)

**Issue**: A single unsupported feature on a CloudKit-bound model disables sync for the entire container, silently.
**Search**:
- `@Attribute\(\.unique\)` — CloudKit forbids unique constraints
- Required (non-optional, non-defaulted) `@Relationship` on cloudKitDatabase models
- `cloudKitDatabase:` configuration in `ModelConfiguration`
**Verify**: Read SwiftData model files; confirm @Attribute(.unique) and required relationships are absent on synced models.
**Fix**: Remove `.unique` (use manual uniqueness if needed); make every property optional or defaulted; mark relationships as inverse-defined and `= []`.

### Pattern 5: Missing Conflict Resolution for iCloud Drive (MEDIUM/MEDIUM)

**Issue**: Without checking `ubiquitousItemHasUnresolvedConflicts`, edits on multiple devices silently lose one side's changes.
**Search**:
- `ubiquitousItemHasUnresolvedConflicts` — conflict detection
- `NSFileVersion` — version-based resolution
**Verify**: Read iCloud Drive document handling files; confirm conflict detection runs before opening/editing each document.
**Fix**: Check `ubiquitousItemHasUnresolvedConflictsKey` on resourceValues, enumerate `NSFileVersion.unresolvedConflictVersionsOfItem(at:)`, present resolution UI or auto-resolve, then mark resolved with `isResolved = true` and `removeOtherVersionsOfItem(at:)`.

### Pattern 6: Legacy CloudKit APIs on iOS 17+ Targets (MEDIUM/LOW)

**Issue**: Hand-rolled `CKFetchRecordZoneChangesOperation` reimplements what `CKSyncEngine` provides — change tokens, retry logic, account-change handling, queue management.
**Search**:
- `CKFetchRecordZoneChangesOperation`, `CKModifyRecordsOperation`
- Manual `serverChangeToken` plumbing
**Verify**: Read deployment target (Info.plist or project settings). If iOS 17+, the legacy approach is a maintenance burden, not a correctness bug.
**Fix**: Migrate to `CKSyncEngine` with a `Configuration(database:, stateSerialization:, delegate:)` and a `CKSyncEngineDelegate` implementation.

### Pattern 7: CKSyncEngine Change Batch Over the 250-Record Cap (HIGH/MEDIUM)

**Issue**: Each request the engine sends is capped at **250 records (saves + deletes combined)**. A hand-assembled batch, or returning thousands of pending changes in one batch during initial/bulk sync, fails the whole request with `CKError.limitExceeded`.
**Search**:
- `nextRecordZoneChangeBatch`
- `RecordZoneChangeBatch\(`
- `pendingRecordZoneChanges`
**Verify**: Read the `nextRecordZoneChangeBatch(_:syncEngine:)` implementation. The bug is constructing the batch by hand (or slicing with a hard-coded size > 250) instead of the failable `CKSyncEngine.RecordZoneChangeBatch(pendingChanges:recordProvider:)` initializer, which stops at the cap.
**Fix**: `return await CKSyncEngine.RecordZoneChangeBatch(pendingChanges:recordProvider:)` — it stops at the cap and leaves the remainder in `pendingRecordZoneChanges` for the next batch. Treat `.limitExceeded` as retry-with-smaller-batch. (Server-side limit; applies on every CKSyncEngine version, iOS 17+.)

### Pattern 8: Persisted or Shipped ExportedAssetID (HIGH/LOW) `OS27`

**Issue**: `CKAsset.ExportedAssetID` (the Photos → CloudKit server-copy path) is `Codable` but **valid only on the same device that created it, and expires after a few days**. Crossing a device boundary, or using it after that expiry, breaks silently — the later `CKAsset(importing:)` fails with `CKError.assetNotAvailable`. Persisting it is fragile for exactly that reason.
**Search**:
- `CKAsset\(importing:`
- `ExportedAssetID`
- `exportedAssetID\(`
**Verify**: Read the surrounding code. The bug is storing or encoding the `ExportedAssetID` (a `Codable` model field, `UserDefaults`, a JSON payload, sent to a server/peer) instead of exporting-then-saving in one flow. Also flag any read of `fileURL` on an imported asset — it is always `nil`.
**Fix**: Export the ID and save the record in the same operation; re-export just before each save; never persist or transmit it. On watchOS there is no producer (`exportedAssetID(for:)` is unavailable) — do not attempt the import path there.

## Phase 3: Reason About iCloud Completeness

Using the iCloud Map from Phase 1 and your domain knowledge, check for what's *missing* — not just what's wrong.

| Question | What it detects | Why it matters |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Is `ubiquityIdentityToken` checked before every iCloud Drive access (not just at launch)? | Stale availability assumption | User signs out mid-session → next access crashes |
| Are all 6 critical `CKError` codes handled (`.quotaExceeded`, `.networkUnavailable`, `.serverRecordChanged`, `.notAuthenticated`, `.zoneNotFound`, `.partialFailure`)? | Incomplete error matrix | Production users hit one of the unhandled codes → silent failure or crash |
| Does the app observe `NSUbiquityIdentityDidChange` / `CKAccountChanged`? | Mid-session account changes | User switches Apple ID → stale data attributed to wrong account |
| If extensions / widgets / Watch app share an iCloud Drive path, is every writer using `NSFileCoordinator`? | Cross-process corruption | App writes coordinated, extension writes raw → race + corruption |
| Are CKSubscriptions registered for push-based change notifications? | Polling instead of push | App polls every N seconds, drains battery, misses updates between polls |
| Is `NSMetadataQuery` started/stopped at appropriate lifecycle points (not started indefinitely)? | Background CPU drain | Query runs in background even when feature is unused |
| Is there a fallback UX when iCloud is unavailable (offline mode, local-only path)? | Hard dependency on iCloud | Sign-out / quota exceeded → app becomes unusable |
| If migrating from `NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore` to CloudKit, is legacy data drained on first launch of new version? | Orphan KV data | Old per-key data invisible after migration |
| Does the app handle `partialFailure` by retrying only the failed records? | Whole-batch retry | Single bad record fails the whole batch, app retries the whole batch indefinitely |
| Is sync state observable for telemetry (success/failure counters, last-sync time, stuck records)? | Silent regressions | Sync stops working in field, never surfaces, support tickets pile up |

Require evidence from the Phase 1 map — don't speculate without reading the code.

## Phase 4: Cross-Reference Findings

Bump severity for these combinations:

| Finding A | + Finding B | = Compound | Severity |
|-----------|------------|-----------|----------|
| Missing NSFileCoordinator (Pattern 1) | Multi-process access (extension / widget / Watch) | Guaranteed corruption — different processes race on every concurrent write | CRITICAL |
| Missing entitlement check (Pattern 3) | iCloud Drive write path | Crash on signed-out user, no graceful path | CRITICAL |
| Missing CKError handling (Pattern 2) | Automated retry loop | Silent infinite retry on `quotaExceeded` → drains user data plan and battery | HIGH |
| SwiftData `@Attribute(.unique)` (Pattern 4) | `cloudKitDatabase:` configured | Sync silently disabled for the entire container | HIGH |
| Missing conflict resolution (Pattern 5) | Multi-device app (iPhone + iPad + Mac) | Edits accumulate conflicts over time, data loss compounds | HIGH |
| Legacy CKDatabase APIs (Pattern 6) | iOS 17+ deployment target | Reinvents CKSyncEngine — every bug fix Apple ships costs you eng time | MEDIUM |
| Missing CKSubscription registration | Time-sensitive sync requirement | Updates lag by polling interval — minutes to hours visible to user | MEDIUM |
| Missing `partialFailure` handling | Batch save of N records | One bad record poisons the whole batch, retries forever | MEDIUM |

Cross-auditor overlap notes:
- CloudKit-synced @Model classes → compound with `swiftdata-auditor` (Pattern 4 specifically)
- iCloud Drive container vs Documents location → compound with `storage-auditor`
- Network connectivity prerequisites for sync → compound with `networking-auditor`
- Sync callbacks on wrong queue → compound with `concurrency-auditor`

## Phase 5: iCloud Health Score

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Subsystems in use | CloudKit / iCloud Drive / KV / SwiftData+CK count |
| Coordination coverage | M of N ubiquitous I/O sites use NSFileCoordinator (Z%) |
| Availability check coverage | M of N entry paths guard with token / accountStatus (Z%) |
| CKError code coverage | M of 6 critical codes handled |
| Account-change observation | yes / no |
| Conflict resolution | implemented / missing / N/A |
| Sync engine | CKSyncEngine / legacy / hand-rolled |
| **Health** | **SAFE / FRAGILE / DANGEROUS** |

Scoring:
- **SAFE**: No CRITICAL issues, every ubiquitous I/O is coordinated, every entry path checks availability, all 6 critical CKError codes handled, account-change observed, conflict resolution present, CKSyncEngine in use on iOS 17+.
- **FRAGILE**: No CRITICAL issues, but some HIGH/MEDIUM patterns (incomplete CKError handling, missing CKSubscriptions, polling pattern, legacy APIs on iOS 17+, missing conflict UI).
- **DANGEROUS**: Any CRITICAL issue (uncoordinated multi-process I/O, missing entitlement check on a crashing path, unique-constraint silently disabling whole-container sync).

3. [Long-term — completeness gaps from Phase 3 (CKSyncEngine migration, telemetry, fallback UX)]
4. [Test plan — sign-out / quota exceeded / multi-device conflict / offline / account switch scenarios]
```

## Output Limits

If >50 issues in one category: Show top 10, provide total count, list top 3 files.
If >100 total issues: Summarize by category, show only CRITICAL/HIGH details.

## False Positives (Not Issues)

- Local file operations (URLs not in iCloud container)
- CloudKit Console / Web Services access (not runtime code)
- Test code with mocked CloudKit / mocked file URLs
- `@Attribute(.unique)` on a model that does NOT set `cloudKitDatabase:` in its `ModelConfiguration`
- Legacy CKDatabase APIs in code paths gated by deployment-target checks (`if #available(iOS 17, *)`)
- One-shot `NSMetadataQuery` that's stopped after first result
- Apps that explicitly opt out of multi-device support (single-device productivity apps)
- A transient `CKAsset(importing:)` whose `ExportedAssetID` is exported and saved in the same flow and never stored (Pattern 8 is about persisting/shipping the ID, not using it)
- A `nextRecordZoneChangeBatch` that already returns `CKSyncEngine.RecordZoneChangeBatch(pendingChanges:recordProvider:)` (the failable initializer already enforces the 250 cap — Pattern 7)
