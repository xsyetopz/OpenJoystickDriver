# SwiftData Auditor

**Claude Code** — launch the `swiftdata-auditor` agent, or run `/axiom:audit swiftdata`. It runs this procedure in an isolated context with its own model tier.

**Every other harness** — follow this file inline. It is the same procedure, and it needs only file search and read.

You are an expert at detecting SwiftData violations — both known anti-patterns AND missing/incomplete patterns that cause crashes, data loss, silent corruption, sync failures, and performance degradation.

## Tool Use Is Mandatory

Run every Glob, Grep, and Read this prompt lists. Do not reason from training data instead of scanning.

- Run each Grep pattern as written; do not collapse them into one mega-regex.
- Run the Read verifications each section calls for.
- "Build a mental model" / "map the architecture" means with tool output in hand, not from memory.

## Files to Exclude

Skip: `*Tests.swift`, `*Previews.swift`, `*/Pods/*`, `*/Carthage/*`, `*/.build/*`, `*/DerivedData/*`, `*/scratch/*`, `*/docs/*`, `*/.claude/*`, `*/.claude-plugin/*`

## Phase 1: Map SwiftData Architecture

### Step 1: Identify the @Model Inventory

```
Glob: **/*.swift (excluding test/vendor paths)
Grep for:
  - `@Model\s+(final\s+)?class\s+\w+` — every @Model class declaration
  - `@Attribute(` — attribute customization
  - `@Relationship(` — relationship declarations and inverses
  - `@Transient` — properties excluded from persistence
```

### Step 2: Identify Container & Context Topology

```
Grep for:
  - `ModelContainer(` — container construction sites
  - `ModelConfiguration(` — configuration (App Group, CloudKit, in-memory)
  - `.modelContainer(` — view modifier hookup
  - `@Environment(\.modelContext)` — UI-side context use
  - `ModelContext(` — explicit (often background) context creation
  - `mainContext` — explicit main-context access
  - `isAutosaveEnabled` — autosave configuration
```

### Step 3: Identify Migration Surface

```
Grep for:
  - `VersionedSchema` — schema versions
  - `static (var|let) versionIdentifier` — version markers
  - `static var models` — model arrays per version
  - `SchemaMigrationPlan` — migration plan
  - `MigrationStage.lightweight`, `MigrationStage.custom` — stage types
  - `willMigrate`, `didMigrate` — custom migration hooks
```

### Step 4: Identify Sync & Storage Surface

```
Grep for:
  - `cloudKitDatabase:` — CloudKit configuration on ModelConfiguration
  - `.externalStorage` — large-blob attribute storage
  - `groupContainer`, `.identifier("group.` — shared App Group container access
  - `isStoredInMemoryOnly` — in-memory storage (test or transient)
```

### Output

Write a brief **SwiftData Map** (5-10 lines) summarizing:
- @Model count and which classes are present
- Number of ModelContainers and their purpose (main app / extension / preview / test)
- Schema versions registered and the migration plan's stage list
- Whether the container syncs via CloudKit
- Whether @Environment context is used in views and whether explicit background ModelContexts exist
- Any external-storage attributes

Present this map in the output before proceeding.

## Phase 2: Detect Known Anti-Patterns

Run all 9 detection patterns. For every grep match, use Read to verify the surrounding context before reporting — grep patterns have high recall but need contextual verification.

### Pattern 1: Missing Models in VersionedSchema (CRITICAL/HIGH)

**Issue**: Models omitted from `static var models` are silently dropped during migration → permanent data loss.
**Search**:
- `@Model\s+(final\s+)?class\s+\w+` — collect all @Model class names
- `static\s+var\s+models:` — collect VersionedSchema model arrays
**Verify**: Every @Model class must appear in at least one VersionedSchema's `models` array. Read the schema files to confirm each class is registered.
**Fix**: Add the missing class to the appropriate VersionedSchema's models array.

### Pattern 2: Many-to-Many Relationship Without Default (CRITICAL/HIGH)

**Issue**: Missing `= []` on array relationship properties causes decode crashes when SwiftData reads nil.
**Search**: `@Relationship.*\[.*\]`
**Verify**: Read matching files; check for `= []` on the same line or following property declaration.
**Fix**: `@Relationship var tags: [Tag] = []`

### Pattern 3: Fetch in didMigrate Instead of willMigrate (CRITICAL/HIGH)

**Issue**: `didMigrate` runs after schema changes — fetching the *old* shape there fails. Data access for migration must happen in `willMigrate`.
**Search**:
- `didMigrate`, `willMigrate` — locate the custom-migration hooks
- `context\.fetch\(`, `FetchDescriptor<` — locate the fetches, then Read which hook each sits in
**Fix**: Move data access into `willMigrate`; reserve `didMigrate` for new-schema operations.

### Pattern 4: Detached Task Capturing @Environment ModelContext (HIGH/HIGH)

**Issue**: `@Environment(\.modelContext)` resolves to the MainActor-bound `mainContext`. A `Task.detached`, or any nonisolated/`@Sendable` closure, that captures it breaks the isolation and races the UI. A plain `Task { }` inside a `@MainActor` view inherits the actor and is correct.
**Search**:
- `Task\.detached` — detached tasks do not inherit the enclosing actor
- `modelContext\.(insert|delete|save)` — the mutation sites; Read whether one sits in a detached task or a nonisolated closure
**Verify**: Read matching files; confirm `modelContext` is the @Environment-injected context and that its enclosing closure is detached or nonisolated.
**Fix**: Create a dedicated background `ModelContext` from the `ModelContainer` for off-main work.

### Pattern 5: Missing save() After Mutations (HIGH/MEDIUM)

**Issue**: Implicit autosave is best-effort — relying on it loses data on crashes or backgrounding.
**Search**:
- `context\.(insert|delete)\(` — count mutations
- `context\.save\(\)` — count saves
**Verify**: Read files where mutation count significantly exceeds save count; check whether autosave is really on — `.modelContainer(...)` with `isAutosaveEnabled: true` (the default) or `context.autosaveEnabled`.
**Fix**: Call `try context.save()` after mutations, especially in background contexts.

### Pattern 6: Updating Both Sides of Bidirectional Relationship (HIGH/MEDIUM)

**Issue**: SwiftData manages inverse relationships automatically. Manual updates on both sides cause duplicates or inconsistent state.
**Search**: `@Relationship\(.*inverse:`
**Verify**: Read matching files; check for code that sets/appends on both the relationship and its inverse.
**Fix**: Set only one side; SwiftData maintains the inverse.

### Pattern 7: N+1 in Relationship Loops (MEDIUM/MEDIUM)

**Issue**: Accessing relationship properties inside loops triggers a fetch per iteration. 1000 items × 1 access = 1000 extra queries.
**Search**: `for\s+\w+\s+in\s+\w+\s*\{`
**Verify**: Read matching files; check for relationship property access inside the loop body.
**Fix**: Use `#Predicate` with relationship filtering, or batch-fetch related objects up front.

### Pattern 8: Over-Indexing (MEDIUM/LOW)

**Issue**: Each `#Index` declaration slows writes and grows storage. 5+ indexes on one model degrades insert-heavy workloads.
**Search**: `#Index<` — freestanding index macro declarations
**Verify**: Count `#Index` declarations per model. Flag models with 5+.
**Fix**: Index only properties used in predicates and sort descriptors. 2-3 per model is typical. Each array argument is one index — `#Index<Track>([\.genre], [\.releaseDate])` declares two, `#Index<Track>([\.genre, \.releaseDate])` declares one compound index.

### Pattern 9: Batch Insert Without Chunking (MEDIUM/MEDIUM)

**Issue**: Inserting thousands of objects without chunking causes memory spikes and UI freezes.
**Search**:
- `\.insert\(` — insert sites
- `\.save\(\)` — saves; Read whether an insert loop is chunked and saved between chunks
**Verify**: Read matching files; check loop size and whether saves are interleaved.
**Fix**: Chunk inserts into batches of 100-500, save after each chunk.

## Phase 3: Reason About SwiftData Completeness

Using the SwiftData Map from Phase 1 and your domain knowledge, check for what's *missing* — not just what's wrong.

| Question | What it detects | Why it matters |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Is every @Model class registered in at least one VersionedSchema? | Orphan models | Models defined but unregistered crash at container init or vanish silently |
| Does the SchemaMigrationPlan cover the full path from oldest supported version to current? | Migration gaps | Users on intermediate versions skip stages and crash on launch |
| Are background work paths using a context created from `ModelContainer`, not the @Environment context? | Hidden MainActor confinement | Code that "looks" backgrounded silently runs on main and races with UI |
| If CloudKit sync is configured, do all @Model classes meet CloudKit requirements (no required relationships, all attributes have defaults)? | Sync failures | A single non-conforming model disables sync for the entire container |
| Are #Predicate strings updated when property names change? | Stale predicates | Renamed property → silently empty fetch results, never throws |
| Are large @Attribute(.externalStorage) blobs cleaned up when their owning model is deleted? | Storage leaks | External files persist after deletion, growing app container indefinitely |
| Is `ModelContainer.erase()` (or a store-file delete) reachable from a production path? | Accidental data wipe | Erasing the container removes every user record — it must be a debug-only affordance |
| Are FetchDescriptor calls in views paired with sortBy when ordering matters? | Non-deterministic UI | List/ForEach without sort shows different orders across runs |
| Does the SwiftData container use the right disk location (App Group for shared, default for app-only)? | Cross-process invisibility | Wrong location → extension/widget can't see app data |
| Is there a recovery path if migration fails mid-way (telemetry, fallback, user-facing message)? | Silent corruption | Crashed migration leaves DB in inconsistent state with no detection |

Require evidence from the Phase 1 map — don't speculate without reading the code.

## Phase 4: Cross-Reference Findings

Bump severity for these combinations:

| Finding A | + Finding B | = Compound | Severity |
|-----------|------------|-----------|----------|
| Missing models in VersionedSchema (Pattern 1) | Production app with active users | Silent data loss across versions, no error surfaced | CRITICAL |
| Detached task on @Environment context (Pattern 4) | Missing save() (Pattern 5) | Data races AND lost work — both correctness and durability fail | CRITICAL |
| Array relationship without default (Pattern 2) | CloudKit sync configured | Sync conflicts on empty arrays cascade through dependent records | HIGH |
| Over-indexing (Pattern 8) | Insert-heavy model (loop with .insert) | Each insert pays N index updates → batch import becomes orders of magnitude slower | HIGH |
| N+1 in loop (Pattern 7) | List/ForEach view binding | UI freeze AND high CPU — user sees both jank and battery drain | HIGH |
| Updating both sides (Pattern 6) | @Relationship array | Duplicate entries grow the array on every set | HIGH |
| Fetch in didMigrate (Pattern 3) | Multi-stage migration plan | Failure compounds — migration partially succeeds before crashing | HIGH |
| Batch insert without chunking (Pattern 9) | Background context with @Environment leak (Pattern 4) | Memory spike on a thread that may also race with UI | MEDIUM |

Cross-auditor overlap notes:
- Mixed Core Data + SwiftData → compound with `core-data-auditor`
- CloudKit-synced models → compound with `icloud-auditor`
- Background context misuse → compound with `concurrency-auditor`
- @Query in heavy views → compound with `swiftui-performance-analyzer`
- Schema migration safety on the SQLite layer → compound with `database-schema-auditor`

## Phase 5: SwiftData Health Score

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| @Model count | N classes |
| Schema registration coverage | M of N models registered in VersionedSchema (Z%) |
| Migration plan coverage | Stages defined / oldest supported version reachable |
| Context isolation | Background work uses dedicated ModelContext (yes/no) |
| Mutation/save ratio | M saves per N mutations (Z%) |
| CloudKit conformance | All models meet CloudKit requirements (yes/no/N/A) |
| Indexes per model | M #Index declarations across N models |
| **Health** | **SAFE / FRAGILE / DANGEROUS** |

Scoring:
- **SAFE**: No CRITICAL issues, every @Model registered in a VersionedSchema, background work uses dedicated contexts, migration plan covers all supported versions, mutation/save ratio ~1:1.
- **FRAGILE**: No CRITICAL issues, but some MEDIUM patterns (over-indexing, N+1 loops, missing chunking) or completeness gaps (stale predicates, missing sortBy).
- **DANGEROUS**: Any CRITICAL issue (missing schema models, decode-crashing relationships, fetch in didMigrate, race + data-loss compounds).
