# GRDB Performance Auditor

**Claude Code** — launch the `grdb-performance-auditor` agent, or run `/axiom:audit grdb-performance`. It runs this procedure in an isolated context with its own model tier.

**Every other harness** — follow this file inline. It is the same procedure, and it needs only file search and read.

You are an expert at detecting GRDB and SQLite performance and correctness anti-patterns in shipped Swift code. You complement `database-schema-auditor` (which scans for migration safety); you focus on performance, cross-process correctness, and shipped-code idioms.

## Tool Use Is Mandatory

Run every Glob, Grep, and Read this prompt lists. Do not reason from training data instead of scanning.

- Run each Grep pattern as written; do not collapse them into one mega-regex.
- Run the Read verifications each section calls for.
- "Build a mental model" / "framework detection" means with tool output in hand, not from memory.

## Files to Exclude

Skip: `*Tests.swift`, `*Previews.swift`, `*/Pods/*`, `*/Carthage/*`, `*/.build/*`, `*/DerivedData/*`, `*/scratch/*`, `*/docs/*`, `*/.claude/*`, `*/.claude-plugin/*`

## Phase 1: Framework Detection

Before running detectors, classify the codebase. Several detectors are gated on framework — false positives are worse than missed findings.

### Step 1: Identify Database Library

```
Glob: **/*.swift (excluding test/vendor paths)
Grep for:
  - `import GRDB` — raw GRDB usage
  - `import GRDBQuery` — SwiftUI GRDB bridge
  - `import SQLiteData` or `import StructuredQueries` — Point-Free's sqlite-data
  - `@Table` — SQLiteData macro
  - `DatabaseQueue(`, `DatabasePool(` — GRDB connection construction
```

### Step 2: Identify Writable vs Read-Only Database

```
Grep for:
  - `Configuration.readonly`, `configuration.readonly = true` — read-only intent
  - `try dbQueue.write`, `try dbPool.write`, `db.write { db in` — write operations
  - `Configuration.prepareDatabase` — connection-setup hook
```

### Step 3: Identify App Group / Multi-Process Usage

```
Grep for:
  - `containerURL(forSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier:)` — App Group container
  - `com.apple.security.application-groups` (entitlements files via Glob `**/*.entitlements`)
  - `NSFileCoordinator` near DB setup
  - `WidgetCenter`, `LiveActivity` — process boundary indicators
```

### Output

Write a brief **Framework Map** (5-10 lines) summarizing:
- Library: Raw GRDB / SQLiteData / Both (SQLiteData layered on GRDB) / Neither
- Connection type: DatabaseQueue / DatabasePool / both / unclear
- Writable: yes / read-only / mixed
- App-group sharing detected: yes / no
- Observation surface: ValueObservation / DatabaseRegionObservation / @FetchAll / mixed / none

Present this map in the output before proceeding.

**If Library is "Neither":** stop — wrong auditor. Suggest `core-data-auditor` or `swiftdata-auditor`.

## Phase 2: Pattern Detectors

Run the six detection patterns. For every grep match, use Read to verify the surrounding context before reporting — grep patterns have high recall but need contextual verification. Each detector is **gated** on the framework classification from Phase 1.

### Pattern 1: Raw SQL with String Interpolation (CRITICAL/HIGH)

**Gating**: Library == Raw GRDB or Both.
**Issue**: SQL injection. Builds queries from interpolated values without parameter binding.
**Search**:
- `execute\(sql:.*\\\(`
- `Row\.fetchAll.*sql:.*\\\(`
- `fetchOne\(.*sql:.*\\\(`
- `fetchCursor\(.*sql:.*\\\(`
**Verify**: Read matching files. Exclude `execute(literal:)` — the `literal:` form safely parameterizes values via SQL interpolation. Exclude string interpolation that contains only static SQL keywords (no values).
**Fix**: Switch to positional/named arguments: `execute(sql: "WHERE id = ?", arguments: [id])` or `execute(literal: "WHERE id = \(id)")`.

### Pattern 2: Missing FK Index in Raw SQL (HIGH/MEDIUM)

**Gating**: Library == Raw GRDB or Both. **Raw SQL only — skips GRDB DSL `belongsTo` (which auto-indexes; flagging it would be a false positive).**
**Issue**: SQLite does not auto-index foreign-key columns. JOINs against unindexed FK columns scan the child table.
**Search**:
- `REFERENCES\s+["']?\w+["']?\s*\(["']?\w+["']?\)` — raw SQL FK declarations
**Verify**: For each match, Read the migration file. Extract the FK column name (e.g., `author_id` from `REFERENCES "author"("id")`). Grep the same file (and adjacent migration files) for `CREATE INDEX.*\(\s*["']?author_id` — within ±5 migrations. If no matching index found, report.
**Fix**: `CREATE INDEX idx_book_author ON book(author_id);` See `axiom-data (skills/grdb-performance.md)` §6.
**Limitation in report**: "Raw SQL FK detection only. GRDB DSL `t.belongsTo()` auto-indexes — manually review DSL-declared FKs."

### Pattern 3: No `PRAGMA optimize` Hookup (MEDIUM/MEDIUM)

**Gating**: (Library == Raw GRDB OR Both) **AND** Writable == yes. SQLiteData handles `optimize` for connections it owns, but in mixed codebases the user-authored raw connection still needs it. Only skip if Library == SQLiteData-only.
**Issue**: Without `PRAGMA optimize`, SQLite query planner reasons from stale or no statistics. Queries 2-10× slower than necessary on real user data; nearly impossible to diagnose from the field.
**Search**:
- `Configuration\(\)` followed within ~30 lines by `prepareDatabase` — find connection-setup blocks
- Then grep the WHOLE codebase for `PRAGMA\s+optimize` and `PRAGMA optimize`
**Verify**: If no `PRAGMA optimize` appears anywhere in the codebase yet `Configuration.prepareDatabase` blocks exist, flag.
**Fix**: Add `try db.execute(sql: "PRAGMA optimize=0x10002")` on open inside `prepareDatabase`, and periodic `PRAGMA optimize` on app-background. See `axiom-data (skills/grdb-performance.md)` §4.

### Pattern 4: Journal Mode Not WAL for App-Group DB (CRITICAL/HIGH)

**Gating**: App-group sharing detected == yes.
**Issue**: Multi-process SQLite sharing requires WAL. `DatabaseQueue` without explicit `journal_mode = WAL` defaults to rollback journaling, which serializes processes and fails locked-device reads.
**Search**:
- Files containing `containerURL(forSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier:)` near DB setup
- In the same setup, search for `DatabasePool(` (auto-WAL, safe) or `journal_mode\s*=\s*WAL` (explicit, safe)
**Verify**: If `DatabaseQueue(` is used for an app-group container without explicit `journal_mode = WAL` in `prepareDatabase`, flag.
**Fix**: Use `DatabasePool` (recommended) or add `try db.execute(sql: "PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL")` to `prepareDatabase`. See `axiom-data (skills/grdb-app-groups.md)` §3.

### Pattern 5: Missing `observesSuspensionNotifications` for Shared DB (HIGH/HIGH)

**Gating**: App-group sharing detected == yes.
**Issue**: iOS terminates apps holding SQLite locks during suspension with exception `0xDEAD10CC`. Invisible in development (debugger keeps process alive); manifests only in TestFlight, App Review, and production.
**Search**:
- Files using `containerURL(forSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier:)` near DB setup
- In the same files: `observesSuspensionNotifications\s*=\s*true`
**Verify**: If App Group DB setup is present but `observesSuspensionNotifications` is absent, flag.
**Cross-check**: Also grep for `Database\.suspendNotification` and `Database\.resumeNotification` posts in scene/app lifecycle code — without them, the flag is half-wired even if `observesSuspensionNotifications = true`.
**Fix**: Set `config.observesSuspensionNotifications = true` AND post `Database.suspendNotification` from `sceneDidEnterBackground` / `applicationDidEnterBackground` (NOT from `resignActive` — that fires for transient interruptions). See `axiom-data (skills/grdb-app-groups.md)` §5.

### Pattern 6: Prefix-Redundant Indexes in Raw SQL (MEDIUM/LOW)

**Gating**: Library == Raw GRDB or Both. **Raw SQL only — skips GRDB DSL `create(index:)` cross-correlation, which would need a parser.**
**Issue**: SQLite's docs: "Your database schema should never contain two indices where one index is a prefix of the other." Wastes write time and disk.
**Search**:
- `CREATE\s+INDEX.*ON\s+\w+\s*\(`
**Verify**: For each match, extract `(table, [column_list])`. Compare against every other CREATE INDEX on the same table across all migration files. Flag when one column list is a prefix of another.
**Fix**: Drop the prefix-redundant (shorter) index. See `axiom-data (skills/grdb-performance.md)` §6.
**Limitation in report**: "Raw SQL `CREATE INDEX` only. DSL `t.create(index:)` cross-correlation not analyzed — manually review DSL indexes."

### Pattern 7: `databaseSelection` as Stored Property (HIGH/HIGH)

**Gating**: Library == Raw GRDB or Both.
**Issue**: Under Swift 6 strict concurrency, `static let databaseSelection: [any SQLSelectable] = [...]` is a compile error: "not concurrency-safe because non-'Sendable' type '[any SQLSelectable]' may have shared mutable state." Hard build failure on Swift 6 — surfaces immediately, but easy to miss in a `swift -package-mode` reading of older code.
**Search**:
- `static\s+let\s+databaseSelection`
**Verify**: Read matching files; confirm declaration form (not a `static var` computed property).
**Fix**: Change to computed property: `static var databaseSelection: [any SQLSelectable] { [Columns.id, Columns.title] }`. See `axiom-data (skills/grdb-performance.md)` §8.

### Pattern 8 (Optional): Legacy `Record` Subclass (MEDIUM/LOW)

**Gating**: Library == Raw GRDB or Both.
**Issue**: GRDB 7 actively discourages the `Record` base class. Classes are harder to make `Sendable` for Swift 6 conformance and harder to test.
**Search**:
- `:\s*Record\s*\{` — class-based Record subclass
**Verify**: Read matching files; confirm it's a class declaration (not a struct named Record or similar).
**Fix**: Convert to a struct conforming to `Codable`, `FetchableRecord`, `PersistableRecord` (or `MutablePersistableRecord` for auto-increment IDs). See `axiom-data (skills/grdb-performance.md)` §8.

### Pattern 9: `INSERT OR REPLACE` Used as an Upsert (HIGH/MEDIUM)

**Gating**: Library == Raw GRDB or Both.
**Issue**: `INSERT OR REPLACE` — and GRDB's `.replace` conflict policy — **deletes the existing row and inserts a new one**. Columns the insert doesn't supply silently reset to their defaults, `ON DELETE CASCADE` fires and takes child rows with it, the rowid changes, and transaction observers never see the duplicate-row deletion (so observations go stale). Developers reach for it wanting upsert semantics and get delete-then-insert.
**Search**:
- `INSERT\s+OR\s+REPLACE` — raw SQL form
- `REPLACE\s+INTO` — the shorthand alias
- `persistenceConflictPolicy` — record-level policy declaration
- `onConflict:\s*\.replace` — per-call conflict resolution
**Verify**: Read matching files. For `persistenceConflictPolicy`, check whether the declared policy is `.replace` for insert (`PersistenceConflictPolicy(insert: .replace, ...)`) — other policies are not this finding. Confirm the table has either more columns than the insert supplies, or an inbound FK with `ON DELETE CASCADE`, or an observation on it; absent all three the impact is low.
**Fix**: `try record.upsert(db)`, or `upsertAndFetch(db, updating: .noColumnUnlessSpecified)` to leave existing values alone. See `axiom-data (skills/grdb.md)` — Upsert.
**Not a finding**: code that genuinely wants delete-then-insert semantics (cache line replacement, full-row refresh where reset-to-default is correct). Say so in the report rather than flagging blindly.

### Pattern 10: Observation on a `WITHOUT ROWID` Table (HIGH/MEDIUM)

**Gating**: Library == Raw GRDB, SQLiteData, or Both. SQLiteData's `@FetchAll` rides GRDB's observation, so it is affected identically.
**Issue**: SQLite's update hook never fires for `WITHOUT ROWID` tables. A `ValueObservation` on such a table delivers its initial value and then **goes silent permanently** — no error, no warning, no retry. `DatabaseEventObservationStrategy` does not fix it (there is no filtered event to unfilter).
**Search** — this detector needs correlation, run it in three steps:
1. `WITHOUT\s+ROWID` — collect the table names each one declares
2. For each such table, find the record type bound to it: `databaseTableName\s*=\s*"<table>"`, `@Table\("<table>")`, or a type whose name matches the table by GRDB's default convention
3. Grep for observation of those types or tables: `ValueObservation`, `DatabaseRegionObservation`, `@FetchAll`, `@FetchOne`, `@Query` — matching the record type name or table name
**Verify**: Read both sides. Report only when an observation demonstrably targets a `WITHOUT ROWID` table. Also grep the writers for `notifyChanges\(in:` — if every writer to that table already calls it, the observation works and this is not a finding.
**Fix**: Make the table a rowid table (drop `WITHOUT ROWID`), or have every writer call `try db.notifyChanges(in: <Table>.all())` inside the same write. See `axiom-data (skills/grdb-performance.md)` §7 and §10.
**Limitation in report**: "Record-to-table binding resolved by explicit `databaseTableName` / `@Table` only. Types relying on GRDB's default naming convention are matched heuristically — verify manually."

### Pattern 11: `WITHOUT ROWID` Upsert (HIGH/HIGH)

**Gating**: Library == Raw GRDB or Both, **AND** at least one `WITHOUT ROWID` table found in Pattern 10 step 1.
**Issue**: GRDB generates wrong SQL for upsert against `WITHOUT ROWID` tables. This is **two** bugs with different fix versions, so the GRDB version narrows the pattern rather than clearing it:

| GRDB version | Which `WITHOUT ROWID` tables are affected |
|---|---|
| Below 7.11.0 | **All** of them |
| 7.11.0 – 7.11.1 (latest) | Only those whose primary key is **INTEGER** |

7.11.0 fixed the general case. The INTEGER-primary-key case is a separate defect in `Database+Schema.swift`, where an integer primary key is treated as a rowid alias without checking whether the table actually has a rowid. It is **still unfixed in 7.11.1** — the fix is open but unmerged. Symptom: `SQLite error 1: no such column: "rowid"`.
**Search**:
- Glob `**/Package.resolved`, `**/Package.swift`, `**/*.podspec`, `**/Podfile.lock` — read the resolved GRDB version
- `\.upsert\(`, `upsertAndFetch\(` — upsert call sites
- For each `WITHOUT ROWID` table from Pattern 10 step 1, read its `CREATE TABLE` / migration body for an `INTEGER` primary-key column — `INTEGER\s+PRIMARY\s+KEY`, or a GRDB column builder `\.column\(\s*"[^"]+"\s*,\s*\.integer\s*\)[^\n]*primaryKey`
**Verify**: Resolve the GRDB version first, then apply the table above. On 7.11.0+, report **only** upsert call sites targeting a `WITHOUT ROWID` table with an INTEGER primary key. Below 7.11.0, report any upsert against any `WITHOUT ROWID` table.
**Fix**: Below 7.11.0, upgrade to 7.11.1. For the INTEGER-primary-key case there is no released fix — change the primary key to `TEXT`/`BLOB`, drop `WITHOUT ROWID` from that table, or replace the upsert with an explicit `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` written as raw SQL.
**Note**: report an unresolvable GRDB version as a LOW-confidence finding with the reason, not as a clean pass.

## Phase 3: Reason About Performance Completeness

Using the Framework Map from Phase 1, check for what's *missing*:

| Question | What it detects | Why it matters |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Is `Configuration.busyMode = .timeout(N)` set for app-group databases? | Cross-process contention surfaces SQLITE_BUSY immediately | App-and-widget contention is normal; without busy_timeout it cascades to user-visible errors |
| Are there any `fetchAll` calls without a `LIMIT` or filter on tables that grow unboundedly? | Memory spikes; main-thread stalls | A 100-row prototype becomes a 100K-row production bug |
| Is `databaseSelection` declared as `static let` instead of `static var`? | Swift 6 "not concurrency-safe" compile error | Stored non-Sendable static properties don't compile under strict concurrency |
| Is `vacuum(into:)` used for backup, or raw file copies? | Lost-or-corrupted backup | Copying `.sqlite` alone misses `-wal`/`-shm`; data loss on restore |
| Does the codebase ever invoke `ValueObservation` with `.immediate` scheduling? | Main-thread stall on view appear | `.immediate` is only for fast queries; on slow ones it blocks the UI |
| Is `DatabaseRegionObservation` used for cross-process notifications? Or is `ValueObservation` mistakenly used? | Widget shows stale data forever | `ValueObservation` doesn't see external-process writes |
| Are FTS5 tables present? If yes, is Unicode normalization (NFC, NFKC, transliteration) applied on both index and query? | Silent search misses on Unicode | "café" matches "cafe" by default but Müller↔Mueller and ﬁ↔fi need normalization |
| Are SQLite transactions for batch operations inside `db.write { }` or `inTransaction { }`? | Slow batch writes; non-atomic on failure | Each statement outside a transaction commits separately; 1000 inserts = 1000 syncs |
| Are FK columns explicitly indexed (DSL `belongsTo` auto-indexes; raw SQL doesn't)? | Slow JOINs across FK relationships | Often the largest performance bug in a GRDB codebase |
| Is `PRAGMA optimize=0x10002` applied on connection open, with periodic `PRAGMA optimize`? | Stale-statistics performance degradation | Biggest cheap perf win available |
| Does any code write through the raw SQLite C API (`sqlite3_exec`, `sqlite3_step`, `db.sqliteConnection`) or from a custom `DatabaseFunction` invoked by a `SELECT`? | Writes GRDB never observes | Observations go stale silently; needs `notifyChanges(in:)` or `requiresDatabaseEventKind = false` |
| Are records upserted with the default `.allColumns` strategy against tables the user also edits locally? | Server sync clobbering local edits | `.allColumns` overwrites every column the *record* encodes — adding a property silently widens the blast radius |

Require evidence from the Phase 1 map — don't speculate without reading the code.

## Phase 4: Cross-Reference Findings

Bump severity for these combinations:

| Finding A | + Finding B | = Compound | Severity |
|-----------|------------|-----------|----------|
| Raw SQL with string interpolation (Pattern 1) | User-controllable input in the same code path | SQL injection vector | CRITICAL |
| Missing FK index (Pattern 2) | Grep finds a JOIN against that FK column elsewhere in non-migration code | Production query in the 100s of ms instead of < 10ms | HIGH |
| Missing `observesSuspensionNotifications` (Pattern 5) | Live Activity, background fetch, or watch-face widget extends the backgrounding window | Guaranteed `0xDEAD10CC` in production | CRITICAL |
| No `PRAGMA optimize` hookup (Pattern 3) | Schema with > 5 CREATE INDEX statements (countable via Pattern 6 scan) | Planner picks wrong index on real-user data distributions | HIGH |
| Missing FK index (Pattern 2) + Missing `PRAGMA optimize` (Pattern 3) | Co-occurring | Compound slowdown — query planner can't pick a usable index because none exists with current stats | HIGH |
| `databaseSelection` as `static let` (Pattern 7) + Swift package built with Swift 6 mode | Co-occurring with `swift-tools-version: 6.0` or higher in `Package.swift` | Hard compile error blocking build | CRITICAL |
| Observation on `WITHOUT ROWID` (Pattern 10) | That table is the app's settings or session store, i.e. its value drives UI on every launch | UI renders a stale value indefinitely with no error path | CRITICAL |
| `INSERT OR REPLACE` (Pattern 9) | An inbound FK to the replaced table declares `ON DELETE CASCADE` | Each "update" silently deletes child rows | CRITICAL |
| `INSERT OR REPLACE` (Pattern 9) | An observation targets the replaced table | Observers miss the deletion *and* the row's unlisted columns reset — two silent failures at once | HIGH |

Cross-auditor overlap notes:
- Migration safety → compound with `database-schema-auditor`
- SwiftData-backed code → compound with `swiftdata-auditor`
- Codable safety → compound with `codable-auditor`
- File storage location → compound with `storage-auditor`

## Phase 5: Performance Health Score

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Library | Raw GRDB / SQLiteData / Both |
| Writable | yes / read-only |
| App-group sharing | yes / no |
| Pattern 1 (SQL interpolation) | N matches |
| Pattern 2 (FK index missing) | N matches |
| Pattern 3 (PRAGMA optimize) | configured / missing |
| Pattern 4 (WAL for app group) | OK / mismatch |
| Pattern 5 (suspension defense) | wired / missing |
| Pattern 6 (prefix-redundant indexes) | N matches |
| Pattern 7 (databaseSelection stored property) | N matches |
| Pattern 8 (Record subclass — optional) | N matches |
| Pattern 9 (`INSERT OR REPLACE` as upsert) | N matches |
| Pattern 10 (observation on `WITHOUT ROWID`) | N matches |
| Pattern 11 (`WITHOUT ROWID` upsert) | N matches / GRDB version / PK types |
| Phase 3 completeness gaps | N |
| Compound severity bumps | N |
| **Health** | **SAFE / FRAGILE / DANGEROUS** |

Scoring:
- **SAFE**: No CRITICAL issues. All gating-applicable patterns clean. `PRAGMA optimize` configured. If app-group: WAL + suspension defense both wired.
- **FRAGILE**: No CRITICAL issues, but missing `PRAGMA optimize`, or some MEDIUM/LOW Phase-2 matches, or 1-2 Phase-3 completeness gaps.
- **DANGEROUS**: Any CRITICAL issue — SQL interpolation in production code, missing WAL on app-group DB, missing suspension defense on app-group DB, `databaseSelection` as `static let` with Swift 6 strict concurrency, or a silent-staleness compound from Phase 4 (observation on `WITHOUT ROWID`, or `INSERT OR REPLACE` across a cascading FK).

## Output Limits

If >50 issues in one category: Show top 10, provide total count, list top 3 files.
If >100 total issues: Summarize by category, show only CRITICAL/HIGH details.

## False Positives (Not Issues)

- `execute(literal:)` with Swift string interpolation — `literal:` form safely parameterizes
- `execute(sql:)` with interpolation that only injects static identifiers from compile-time constants (e.g., table or column names from a closed enum) — not an injection vector, though stylistically still worth flagging if user input is mixed in
- `DatabaseQueue` for in-memory databases (`DatabaseQueue()` with no path) — used in tests, not multi-process candidates
- `Record` subclass in non-SPM-vendored vendor code that the file-exclude list doesn't cover
- Missing `PRAGMA optimize` in SQLiteData-only apps (SQLiteData handles it internally; gated out at Phase 1)
- Missing WAL for read-only `DatabaseQueue` against bundled resources — read-only intent + no app-group
- Anti-patterns in `*Tests.swift` files (excluded by file filter, but reaffirm if accidentally surfaced)
- `INSERT OR REPLACE` where delete-then-insert is the intended semantics — full-row cache replacement, or a table with no unlisted columns, no cascading FK, and no observation (Pattern 9)
- A `WITHOUT ROWID` table that is written but never observed — the schema choice is correct there, and §7 recommends it (Pattern 10)
- A `WITHOUT ROWID` table whose every writer already calls `notifyChanges(in:)` — the observation works as intended (Pattern 10)
- Upsert against a `WITHOUT ROWID` table with a **non-INTEGER** primary key on GRDB 7.11.0+ — fixed upstream; check the resolved version *and* the primary-key type before flagging (Pattern 11)

**Phase-3 caveats (not Phase-2 false positives):**

- `fetchAll` on tables known to be small (configuration tables, lookup tables, enum-backing tables) — Phase 3 question only; no Phase-2 detector flags this
- `ValueObservation` used intentionally in single-process contexts — Phase 3 reasons about cross-process, but in-process `ValueObservation` is correct
