# Concurrency

**You MUST use this skill for ANY concurrency, async/await, threading, or Swift 6 concurrency work.**

<!-- AXIOM_AUDITOR_INLINE_BEGIN — auto-maintained by scripts/build-inlined-auditors.ts; do not hand-edit -->
> **Not on Claude Code?** Where this router says "Launch `some-auditor` agent", read that auditor's file in this suite and follow it inline — the same procedure, needing only file search and read.

>
> Agents that need Bash — builds, tests, simulators, crash symbolication — stay Claude Code-only; there is no inline equivalent for those.

## Decision Tree

```dot
digraph concurrency {
    start [label="Concurrency task" shape=ellipse];
    what [label="What do you need?" shape=diamond];

    start -> what;
    what -> "skills/swift-concurrency.md" [label="async/await, actors,\nSendable, data races,\nSwift 6 migration"];
    what -> "skills/swift-concurrency-ref.md" [label="API syntax lookup\n(TaskGroup, AsyncStream,\ncontinuations, migration)"];
    what -> "skills/synchronization.md" [label="Mutex, locks,\natomic types"];
    what -> "skills/assume-isolated.md" [label="assumeIsolated,\n@preconcurrency"];
    what -> "skills/isolation-inheritance-diag.md" [label="warning-free build crashes\n_dispatch_assert_queue_fail\n_swift_task_checkIsolatedSwift"];
    what -> "skills/concurrency-profiling.md" [label="profile async perf,\nactor contention"];
}
```

1. Data races / actor isolation / @MainActor / Sendable / Swift 6 migration? → `skills/swift-concurrency.md`
1a. Need specific API syntax (actor definition, TaskGroup, AsyncStream, continuations)? → `skills/swift-concurrency-ref.md`
1b. NotificationCenter observer, `userInfo` casting, or Sendable errors unpacking a notification? → `skills/swift-concurrency-ref.md` (Typed Notifications — `MainActorMessage`/`AsyncMessage`, iOS 26+)
2. Writing async/await code? → `skills/swift-concurrency.md`
3. assumeIsolated / @preconcurrency? → `skills/assume-isolated.md`
3a. Warning-free Swift 6 build that crashes in production with `_dispatch_assert_queue_fail` or `_swift_task_checkIsolatedSwift`? → `skills/isolation-inheritance-diag.md`
4. Mutex / lock / synchronization? → `skills/synchronization.md`
5. Profile async performance / actor contention? → `skills/concurrency-profiling.md`
6. Value type / ARC / generic optimization? → See axiom-performance (skills/swift-performance.md)
7. borrowing / consuming / ~Copyable? → See axiom-swift (skills/ownership-conventions.md)
8. Combine / @Published / AnyCancellable / reactive streams? → See axiom-uikit (skills/combine-patterns.md)
9. Want automated concurrency scan? → concurrency-auditor (Agent)

## Conflict Resolution

**concurrency vs axiom-performance**: When app freezes or feels slow:
1. **Try concurrency FIRST** — Main thread blocking is the #1 cause of UI freezes. Check for synchronous work on @MainActor before profiling.
2. **Only use axiom-performance** if concurrency fixes don't help — Profile after ruling out obvious blocking.
3. **To pin a specific freeze to app code**, see the Hang Window Workflow in axiom-performance (skills/hang-diagnostics.md) — re-scope `xcprof analyze` to the hang window with `--start-ms/--end-ms --user-binary` to surface the app-owned frame on the main thread.

**concurrency vs axiom-build**: When seeing Swift 6 concurrency errors:
- **Use concurrency, NOT axiom-build** — Concurrency errors are CODE issues, not environment issues.

**concurrency vs axiom-data**: When concurrency errors involve Core Data or SwiftData:
- Core Data threading (NSManagedObjectContext thread confinement) → **use axiom-data first**
- SwiftData + @MainActor ModelContext → **use concurrency**
- General "background saves losing data" → **use axiom-data first**
- GRDB Sendable patterns (struct records, `databaseSelection` as computed property, Swift 6 conformance) → See axiom-data (skills/grdb-performance.md) §8

## Critical Patterns

**Swift Concurrency** (`skills/swift-concurrency.md`):
- Progressive journey: single-threaded → async → concurrent → actors
- @concurrent attribute for forced background execution
- Isolated conformances, main actor mode
- 12 copy-paste patterns including delegate value capture, weak self in Tasks
- Comprehensive decision tree for 7 common error messages

**API Reference** (`skills/swift-concurrency-ref.md`):
- Actor definition, reentrancy, global actors, nonisolated
- Sendable patterns, @unchecked Sendable, sending parameter
- Task/TaskGroup/cancellation, async let, withDiscardingTaskGroup
- AsyncStream, continuations, buffering policies
- Isolation patterns (#isolation, @preconcurrency, nonisolated(unsafe))
- DispatchQueue/DispatchGroup/completion handler migration

**Synchronization** (`skills/synchronization.md`):
- Mutex (iOS 18+), OSAllocatedUnfairLock (iOS 16+), Atomic types
- Lock vs actor decision tree
- Danger patterns: locks across await, semaphores in async context

**Profiling** (`skills/concurrency-profiling.md`):
- Swift Concurrency Instruments template
- Diagnosing main thread blocking, actor contention, thread pool exhaustion
- Safe vs unsafe primitives for cooperative pool

**Runtime Isolation Crashes** (`skills/isolation-inheritance-diag.md`):
- `_dispatch_assert_queue_fail` and `_swift_task_checkIsolatedSwift` signatures
- Closure isolation inheritance (Core Data `perform`, Combine `.map`, NotificationCenter `.sink`)
- Delegate method isolation inheritance (CLLocationManager, NSDocument, AVAudioPlayerDelegate, WKNavigationDelegate)
- `MainActor.assumeIsolated` misuse
- Actor reentrancy state staleness

## Automated Scanning

**Concurrency audit** → Launch `concurrency-auditor` agent or `/axiom:audit concurrency` (5-phase semantic audit: maps isolation architecture, detects 8 anti-patterns, reasons about missing concurrency patterns, correlates compound risks, scores Swift 6.4 readiness)

## Anti-Rationalization

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Just add @MainActor and it'll work" | @MainActor has isolation inheritance rules. `skills/swift-concurrency.md` covers all patterns. |
| "I'll use nonisolated(unsafe) to silence the warning" | Silencing warnings hides data races. `skills/swift-concurrency.md` shows the safe pattern. |
| "It's just one async call" | Even single async calls have cancellation and isolation implications. |
| "I know how actors work" | Actor reentrancy and isolation rules changed in Swift 6.2. |
| "I'll fix the Sendable warnings later" | Sendable violations cause runtime crashes. Fix them now. |
| "My Swift 6 build has zero warnings, so isolation is correct" | Static checking can't see SDK callbacks. Runtime checks crash anyway. `skills/isolation-inheritance-diag.md`. |
| "I'll wrap the crash in `MainActor.assumeIsolated`" | `assumeIsolated` is a runtime trap, not a silencer. Wrong assumption = crash. |
| "Combine is dead, just use async/await" | Combine has no deprecation notice. Rewriting working pipelines wastes time. See See axiom-uikit (skills/combine-patterns.md). |
| "I'll use @unchecked Sendable to silence this" | You're hiding a data race from the compiler. It will crash in production. |
| "This async function runs on a background thread" | Check its isolation, don't assume. A `@MainActor` async function runs entirely on the main actor, and `nonisolated async` runs on the caller's actor under `NonisolatedNonsendingByDefault` (Swift 6.2+; new Xcode projects set `SWIFT_APPROACHABLE_CONCURRENCY = YES`, the setting's own default is NO, and SwiftPM does not enable it) — those are the main-thread freezes. Without that setting `nonisolated async` hops to the global executor. `@concurrent` forces off-actor work either way. |
