# Modern Swift Idioms

## Purpose

Claude frequently generates outdated Swift patterns from its training data. This skill corrects the most common ones — patterns that compile fine but use legacy APIs when modern equivalents are clearer, more efficient, or more correct.

**Philosophy**: "Don't repeat what LLMs already know — focus on edge cases, surprises, soft deprecations." (Paul Hudson)

## Modern API Replacements

| Old Pattern | Modern Swift | Since | Why |
|-------------|-------------|-------|-----|
| `Date()` | `Date.now` | 5.6 | Clearer intent |
| `filter { }.count` | `count(where:)` | 6.0 | Single pass, no intermediate allocation (SE-0220; reverted before 5.0 shipped, re-introduced in 6.0) |
| `replacingOccurrences(of:with:)` | `replacing(_:with:)` | 5.7 | Swift native, no Foundation bridge |
| `CGFloat` | `Double` | 5.5 | Implicit bridging; exceptions: optionals, inout, ObjC-bridged APIs |
| `Task.sleep(nanoseconds:)` | `Task.sleep(for: .seconds(1))` | 5.7 | Type-safe Duration API |
| `DateFormatter()` | `.formatted()` / `FormatStyle` | 5.5 | No instance management, localizable by default |
| `String(format: "%.2f", val)` | `val.formatted(.number.precision(.fractionLength(2)))` | 5.5 | Type-safe, localized |
| `localizedCaseInsensitiveContains()` | `localizedStandardContains()` | 5.0 | Handles diacritics, ligatures, width variants |
| `"\(firstName) \(lastName)"` | `PersonNameComponents` with `.formatted()` | 5.5 | Respects locale name ordering |
| `"yyyy-MM-dd"` with DateFormatter | `try Date(string, strategy: .iso8601)` | 5.6 | Modern parsing (throws); use "y" not "yyyy" for display |
| `contains()` on user input | `localizedStandardContains()` | 5.0 | Required for correct text search/filtering |

## Modern Syntax

| Old Pattern | Modern Swift | Since |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| `if let value = value {` | `if let value {` | 5.7 |
| Explicit `return` in single-expression | Omit `return`; `if`/`switch` are expressions | 5.9 |
| `Circle()` in modifiers | `.circle` (static member lookup) | 5.5 |
| `import UIKit`/`import AppKit` in a SwiftUI file to reach `UIViewController`, `UIView`, `UIApplication` or gesture recognizers | **Not needed** — those resolve through `import SwiftUI` alone. SwiftUI's Clang umbrella header imports UIKit (AppKit on macOS, WatchKit on watchOS); the swiftinterface's `@_exported` list — CoreGraphics, CoreTransferable, DeveloperToolsSupport, SwiftUICore — is a separate thing and not the full story. Verified by compiling with only `import SwiftUI` against the iOS 27.2 and macOS 27.2 SDKs. Add the import explicitly only if you prefer it for clarity | — |

## Foundation Modernization

| Old Pattern | Modern Foundation | Since |
|-------------|------------------|-------|
| `FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, ...)` | `URL.documentsDirectory` | 5.7 |
| `url.appendingPathComponent("file")` | `url.appending(path: "file")` | 5.7 |
| `books.sorted { $0.author < $1.author }` (repeated) | Conform to `Comparable`, call `.sorted()` | — |
| `"yyyy"` in date format for display | `"y"` — correct in all calendar systems | — |

## SwiftUI Convenience APIs Claude Misses

- **`ContentUnavailableView.search(text: searchText)`** (iOS 17+) automatically includes the search term — no need to compose a custom string
- **`LabeledContent` in Forms** (iOS 16+) provides consistent label alignment without manual HStack layout
- **`confirmationDialog()` must attach to triggering UI** — Liquid Glass morphing animations depend on the source element

## Swift 6.4 Language Features (OS27)

Swift 6.4 ships with Xcode 27 (the toolchain also folds in the 6.3 work). Prefer these in new code:

| Feature | Use | Replaces |
|---------|-----|----------|
| `@available(anyAppleOS 27, *)` / `#if os(anyAppleOS)` | One token for **all** Apple OSes | Verbose `@available(iOS 27, macOS 27, watchOS 27, tvOS 27, visionOS 27, *)` |
| `weak let` | Immutable weak ref → the class can be `Sendable`, not `@unchecked Sendable` | `weak var` forcing `@unchecked Sendable` |
| `class T: ~Sendable` | Explicitly suppress `Sendable` (subclasses can still add it back) | No prior syntax |
| Second memberwise init | A struct mixing `internal` + `private` stored properties also gets an `internal` memberwise init usable from other files | Hand-written init |
| `@diagnose(Group, as: …)` | Set one diagnostic group's severity (`ignored` / `warning` / `error`) for a single declaration | Project-wide `-Wwarning`/`-Werror`, blanket suppression |
| `isTriviallyIdentical(to:)` (SE-0494) | O(1) storage-identity fast path before an O(n) `==` in hot comparison paths | Nothing — layers on `==`, never replaces it (see below) |

```swift
// anyAppleOS — one availability token for the whole 27 cycle
@available(anyAppleOS 27, *)
func showStatus() { ... }

@available(anyAppleOS 27, *)
@available(tvOS, unavailable)              // still exclude specific platforms
func launch() { ... }

// weak let → Sendable without the escape hatch.
// `weak var` here fails with "stored property 'dockedAt' of 'Sendable'-conforming
// class 'Spacecraft' is mutable" — that is what forced @unchecked Sendable before.
// The referent must itself be Sendable, and the `let` still needs an initializer.
final class Spacecraft: Sendable {
    weak let dockedAt: SpaceStation?
    init(dockedAt: SpaceStation?) { self.dockedAt = dockedAt }
}

// @diagnose — scope a diagnostic group's severity to one declaration.
// First argument is a diagnostic-group identifier (e.g. DeprecatedDeclaration),
// NOT a bare keyword. It governs diagnostics emitted inside that declaration.
@diagnose(DeprecatedDeclaration, as: ignored)
func usesLegacyAPI() { oldCall() }         // deprecation warning silenced here only

@diagnose(DeprecatedDeclaration, as: error)
func mustNotRegress() { oldCall() }        // hard-fails the build instead
```

`@diagnose` is compiler-gated (needs the Swift 6.4 toolchain), not OS-gated — no `@available` applies. It is the per-declaration counterpart to the whole-module `-Wwarning`/`-Werror <group>` flags.

**Caveat**: `anyAppleOS` requires the Swift 6.4 toolchain (Xcode 27+). For code that must build on older Xcode, keep the explicit per-platform `@available`. Either way, `@available(iOS 27, *)`-style gating remains the authoritative runtime check.

### isTriviallyIdentical(to:) — O(1) equality fast path (SE-0494)

Swift 6.4 adds `isTriviallyIdentical(to:)` to the copy-on-write stdlib types — `String`/`Substring` (and their views), `Array`, `ArraySlice`, `ContiguousArray`, `Dictionary`, `Set` — plus the non-CoW `Unsafe*BufferPointer` family and `UTF8Span`, where identity is pointer+count (`Span`/`RawSpan` spell it `isIdentical(to:)`). It answers "do these two values share the same backing storage?" in O(1).

The contract is asymmetric — this is the entire feature:

| Result | Guarantee |
|--------|-----------|
| `true` | Values ARE equal (`==`) — identical storage cannot differ by value |
| `false` | NO information — values may still be equal (e.g. after a CoW copy) |

Never branch "values differ" on `false`; it only means the fast path didn't apply.

**Availability**: `@_alwaysEmitIntoClient` with no `@available` gate — needs the Swift 6.4 toolchain (Xcode 27) to build, but runs on ANY deployment target. Toolchain-gated, not OS-gated.

**When it pays** — all three must hold; otherwise keep plain `==`:

1. The comparison sits on a hot, repeated path — memoization/cache-invalidation checks, `DynamicProperty.update`, diffing large collections. One-off comparisons don't qualify.
2. The upstream value is storage-stable — a stored property that mutates occasionally. A computed property or freshly built value has new storage on every access, so the check is always `false`.
3. The `false` path is deliberate — either recompute is cheap, or you layer the checks:

```swift
// Memoization invalidation — layered fast path
func shouldRecompute(_ new: [Order]) -> Bool {
    if cached.isTriviallyIdentical(to: new) { return false }  // O(1): same storage ⇒ equal
    return cached != new                                      // false told us nothing — fall back to O(n)
}
```

**The pessimization trap**: replacing `==` wholesale when the upstream produces fresh values makes the check always-`false` and triggers the expensive recompute (often O(n log n)) that a `true` from plain `==` would have skipped — a net loss. Even in SE-0494's favorable benchmark (24,000-element array, mutated element at the tail of the comparison order), the measured win was ~13%. Measure the comparison with signposts before and after switching.

## Swift 6.4 Concurrency Posture

Write Swift 6.4-first code, not Swift 5-era code. These defaults apply to ALL new Swift code, not just when concurrency errors appear.

| Default | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| Assume strict concurrency and MainActor default isolation for app/UI modules | Default for new Xcode 27 app projects (approachable concurrency, Swift 6.2+) |
| Handle errors thrown inside `Task { }` — don't silently ignore them | Swift 6.4 **warns** on an unhandled thrown error in a `Task`; handle in-task or save the task and check later |
| `await` is allowed in `defer` blocks | Swift 6.4 removed the old restriction — clean up with async work directly in `defer` |
| Prefer async/await over GCD, DispatchGroup, and callback pyramids | GCD is a bridge pattern for legacy APIs, not default architecture |
| Async does not mean background — use `@concurrent` (Swift 6.2+) to force off-main | Async functions resume on the same actor they were called from |
| Prefer structured concurrency (`async let`, `TaskGroup`) over unstructured `Task {}` | Structured tasks propagate cancellation and errors automatically |
| Do not use `Task.detached` unless there is a specific, stated reason | Loses actor context, priority, and task-local values |
| Prefer Sendable structs/enums for data that crosses actor boundaries | Value types are inherently safe to share |
| Use actors only for truly shared mutable state across concurrency domains | Don't make every class an actor — UI code stays @MainActor |
| Treat `@unchecked Sendable`, `@preconcurrency`, `nonisolated(unsafe)` as temporary bridge tools | Each should have a removal ticket, not be permanent |
| Do not add escape hatches just to silence compiler errors | They hide data races that crash in production |

## Common Claude Hallucinations

These patterns appear frequently in Claude-generated code:

1. **Creates `DateFormatter` instances inline** — Use `.formatted()` or `FormatStyle` instead. If a formatter must exist, make it `static let`.
2. **Uses `DispatchQueue.main.async`** — Use `@MainActor` or `MainActor.run`. GCD is a bridge pattern, not a default.
3. **Uses `DispatchQueue.global().async` for background work** — Use `@concurrent` (Swift 6.2+) or extract to an actor.
4. **Uses `Task.detached` to "make it background"** — Use `@concurrent`. `Task.detached` loses actor context.
5. **Uses `CGFloat` for SwiftUI parameters** — `Double` works everywhere since Swift 5.5 implicit bridging.
6. **Generates `guard let x = x else`** — Use `guard let x else` shorthand.
7. **Returns explicitly in single-expression computed properties** — Omit `return`.
8. **Spawns unstructured `Task {}` in loops** — Use `TaskGroup` for dynamic parallel work.
9. **Adds `@unchecked Sendable` to silence warnings** — Convert to actor or proper Sendable type.
10. **Writes the verbose 5-platform `@available(iOS 27, macOS 27, …)`** — On Swift 6.4 (Xcode 27), use `@available(anyAppleOS 27, *)`; add per-platform `unavailable` lines only for exclusions.
11. **Uses `weak var` + `@unchecked Sendable`** — On Swift 6.4, `weak let` lets the class be plain `Sendable` with no escape hatch.
12. **Ignores an error thrown in `Task { try … }`** — Swift 6.4 warns; handle it in the task (`do/catch`) or save the task and check the result later.
13. **Puts `[weak self]` on an inner closure nested in an escaping outer closure that already captures `self` strongly** — false safety; Swift 6.4 warns (`[#ImplicitStrongCapture]`). Weaken the OUTER closure (`[weak self]` + `guard let self`), not just the inner. See `axiom-performance (skills/memory-debugging.md)`.
14. **Treats `isTriviallyIdentical(to:)` returning `false` as "values differ"** — `false` carries no information; the values may still be `==` (e.g. after a CoW copy). Only `true` has meaning. See the SE-0494 section above.
