# Liquid Glass Auditor

**Claude Code** — launch the `liquid-glass-auditor` agent, or run `/axiom:audit liquid-glass`. It runs this procedure in an isolated context with its own model tier.

**Every other harness** — follow this file inline. It is the same procedure, and it needs only file search and read.

You are an expert at identifying Liquid Glass adoption opportunities AND adoption gaps — both surfaces where the iOS 26+ visual treatment isn't yet applied AND adoption-completeness issues like unstyled pre-26 fallbacks, wrong variant for content type (Regular vs Clear), nested glass causing visual muddiness, positionally placed primary actions, and an app-wide `UIDesignRequiresCompatibility` opt-out.

## Note on Audit Framing

Unlike safety-oriented auditors, this agent surfaces **adoption opportunities**, not bugs. A codebase with no Liquid Glass adoption is not broken — it's pre-adoption. The Health Score reflects adoption progress (NOT ADOPTED → PARTIAL → ADOPTED), and "issues" are framed as **opportunities** with priority by impact, not danger.

## Tool Use Is Mandatory

Run every Glob, Grep, and Read this prompt lists. Do not reason from training data instead of scanning.

- Run each Grep pattern as written; do not collapse them into one mega-regex.
- Run the Read verifications each section calls for.
- "Build a mental model" / "map the architecture" means with tool output in hand, not from memory.

## Files to Exclude

Skip: `*Tests.swift`, `*Previews.swift`, `*/Pods/*`, `*/Carthage/*`, `*/.build/*`, `*/DerivedData/*`, `*/scratch/*`, `*/docs/*`, `*/.claude/*`, `*/.claude-plugin/*`

## Phase 1: Map Visual Treatment Architecture

### Step 1: Identify Deployment Target and Availability Discipline

Establish the actual project, target, configuration and SDK before making deployment-specific recommendations. Discover both `project.pbxproj` and JSON5 `project.xcproj` at any depth, excluding dependency/cache directories. Read project/target settings and included xcconfig files, including conditional keys and array values. Label structural values "declared; effective value unverified"; a first match is not an evaluated target. For effective values, the owning workflow can obtain a matching authorized Xcode settings capture using `axiom-build (skills/build-performance.md)`, "Project selection and effective settings". Do not launch Xcode under file-read-only scope. Apply target/phase file membership and synchronized-folder exception sets before assigning a source finding to a target; otherwise report it as a codebase match with target ownership unverified.

```
Glob: **/*.swift, **/*.xcconfig, **/*.plist, **/project.pbxproj, **/project.xcproj
Grep for:
  - `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`, `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` — deployment target
  - `UIDesignRequiresCompatibility` in `.plist` files — app-wide opt-out from the new design; read the value. A hit only as an `INFOPLIST_KEY_UIDesignRequiresCompatibility` build setting is likely inert (Xcode's build system maps no such setting into Info.plist), so report it as unconfirmed rather than as an active opt-out
  - `(if|guard) #available\(iOS\s+26`, `(if|guard) #available\(macOS\s+26` — availability gates for Liquid Glass
  - `@available\(iOS\s+26`, `@available\(macOS\s+26` — type/method-level availability
```

### Step 2: Identify Existing Visual Effects (Migration Surface)

```
Grep for:
  - `UIBlurEffect`, `UIVisualEffectView` — UIKit blur (legacy)
  - `NSVisualEffectView` — AppKit blur (legacy)
  - `\.ultraThinMaterial`, `\.thinMaterial`, `\.regularMaterial`, `\.thickMaterial`, `\.ultraThickMaterial`, `\.bar` — SwiftUI Material (legacy on iOS 26+)
  - `\.background\(\.(ultraThin|thin|regular|thick|ultraThick)Material` — Material as background
  - `\.blur\(radius:` — explicit blur (intentional or migration candidate)
```

### Step 3: Identify Existing Glass Adoption

```
Grep for:
  - `\.glassEffect\(` — glass on a view (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS 26)
  - `\.glassEffect\(\.clear` — Clear variant explicit
  - `\.interactive\(` — interactive glass (`Glass.interactive()`, as in `.glassEffect(.regular.interactive())`)
  - `GlassEffectContainer` — grouped glass surfaces
  - `\.buttonStyle\(\.glass` — glass button styles (`.glass`, `.glass(.clear)`, `.glassProminent`)
  - `\.tint\(` paired with glass surfaces
  - `\.glassBackgroundEffect\(` — the visionOS glass API; it doesn't exist on iOS, so count it only for visionOS targets
```

### Step 4: Identify Toolbar, Tab, and Search Surface

```
Grep for:
  - `\.toolbar\s*\{`, `ToolbarItem\(`, `ToolbarItemGroup\(` — toolbar surface
  - `ToolbarSpacer\(` — toolbar grouping between separate `ToolbarItem`s (iOS 26)
  - `placement:\s*\.(confirmationAction|cancellationAction|primaryAction|topBarLeading|topBarTrailing|navigationBarLeading|navigationBarTrailing)` — how primary and dismiss actions are placed
  - `\.buttonStyle\(\.borderedProminent\)`, `\.buttonStyle\(\.bordered\)` — button styles
  - `TabView\(` — tab containers
  - `role:\s*\.search` — search tab, `Tab(role: .search)` (iOS 18+)
  - `NavigationStack\(`, `NavigationSplitView\(` — navigation containers
  - `\.searchable\(` — search field placements
```

### Step 5: Identify Custom Container Surfaces

```
Grep for:
  - `struct\s+\w*(Card|Container|Overlay|Sheet|Gallery|Pane|Tile)\w*\s*:\s*View` — common glass-candidate names
  - `RoundedRectangle\(`, `\.cornerRadius\(`, `\.clipShape\(` — surfaces that could become glass
```

### Step 6: Read Key Files

Read 1-2 representative view files (root container / navigation / a primary screen) to understand:
- Whether the app's chrome (toolbars, tab bars, sidebars) has any glass treatment
- Whether existing blurs/materials are gated behind `if #available(iOS 26, *)`
- Whether glass adoption follows Regular vs Clear variant guidance
- Whether nested view hierarchies stack multiple glass effects
- Whether sheet and editor toolbars place commit and dismiss actions semantically

### Output

Write a brief **Visual Treatment Map** (5-10 lines) summarizing:
- Deployment target (and whether iOS 26+ glass APIs are reachable without availability checks)
- Design opt-out: `UIDesignRequiresCompatibility` absent / NO / YES
- Existing legacy effect surface (UIBlurEffect / NSVisualEffectView / `.material` count)
- Existing glass adoption count (`.glassEffect`, glass button styles; `.glassBackgroundEffect` in visionOS targets only)
- Toolbar surface (number of toolbar definitions, semantic placement of primary and dismiss actions)
- Tab/search structure (TabView with `Tab(role: .search)` / NavigationSplitView with `.searchable` / older patterns)
- Custom-container surfaces (Cards / Galleries / Overlays count)
- Availability discipline (`if #available(iOS 26)` gates present / absent / partial)

Present this map in the output before proceeding.

## Phase 2: Detect Known Adoption Opportunities

Run all 8 detection patterns. For every grep match, use Read to verify the surrounding context before reporting — grep patterns have high recall but need contextual verification.

### Pattern 1: Migration from Old Blur Effects (HIGH/MEDIUM)

**Opportunity**: Blur and material on surfaces that float over content (overlays, control clusters, custom bars) can move to glass on iOS 26+.
**Search**:
- `UIBlurEffect`, `UIVisualEffectView`
- `NSVisualEffectView`
- `\.ultraThinMaterial`, `\.regularMaterial`, `\.thickMaterial`, `\.bar`
**Verify**: Read matching files. Flag only surfaces floating over content; material on a content-layer background (a card in a list, a section background) stays material. A material background on a bar pinned over scrolling content is reported once, under Pattern 8. If deployment target is iOS 26+ with no `if #available` gate, it's a direct replacement candidate; if lower, gate the glass behind `if #available(iOS 26, *)` and keep the material as the fallback.
**Recommendation** (SwiftUI):
```swift
if #available(iOS 26, *) {
    content.glassEffect(.regular, in: .rect(cornerRadius: 16))
} else {
    content.background(.ultraThinMaterial, in: .rect(cornerRadius: 16))
}
```
For UIKit, use `UIVisualEffectView(effect: UIGlassEffect())` (iOS 26); for AppKit, `NSGlassEffectView` with its `contentView` (macOS 26).

### Pattern 2: Toolbar Modernization (MEDIUM/MEDIUM)

**Opportunity**: On iOS 26 the toolbar styles actions by semantic placement: a `.confirmationAction` gets prominent glass automatically and a `.cancellationAction` gets standard glass (`axiom-swiftui (skills/26-ref.md)`, ToolbarItemGroup). Toolbars that hand-place Save/Done/Cancel with positional placements miss that treatment. Items in one `ToolbarItemGroup` share a single glass pill, so actions that should read as separate groups need separate `ToolbarItem`s with `ToolbarSpacer` between them.
**Search**:
- `\.toolbar\s*\{` blocks in sheets or editors that place Save/Done/Cancel with `\.topBarTrailing` / `\.topBarLeading` (or the deprecated `\.navigationBarTrailing` / `\.navigationBarLeading`) instead of `\.confirmationAction` / `\.cancellationAction`
- `ToolbarItemGroup\(` containing `Spacer\(\)` — items the author wanted visually separated inside one shared pill
**Verify**: Read matching files; flag sheet/editor toolbars whose commit and dismiss actions use positional placements, and groups whose items should read as separate clusters.
**Recommendation** (see `axiom-swiftui (skills/toolbars.md)` Patterns 2 and 5):
```swift
.toolbar {
    ToolbarItem(placement: .cancellationAction) { Button("Cancel") { dismiss() } }
    ToolbarItem(placement: .confirmationAction) { Button("Save") { save() } }
}
```
Separate groups of ordinary items with `ToolbarSpacer(.fixed)` between `ToolbarItem`s. A plain `Spacer()` there doesn't compile; it only works inside a `ToolbarItem` or `ToolbarItemGroup`.

### Pattern 3: Custom Containers Without Glass (MEDIUM/MEDIUM)

**Opportunity**: Custom floating card/overlay/control views without glass miss the depth and material that iOS 26 chrome provides. Glass belongs on controls and navigation layered over content, not on content itself.
**Search**:
- `struct\s+\w*(Card|Container|Overlay|Sheet|Gallery|Pane|Tile)\w*\s*:\s*View`
- Verify that the view's body doesn't already include `.glassEffect`
**Verify**: Read matching files; flag floating visible-chrome surfaces (overlays, control clusters), not text-only labels or list content. Skip purely structural containers (HStack/VStack with no visual appearance).
**Recommendation**: Apply `.glassEffect(.regular, in: .rect(cornerRadius: 16))` for surfaces over ordinary content, or `.glassEffect(.clear, in: .rect(cornerRadius: 16))` over media. Group nearby glass elements in a `GlassEffectContainer`.

### Pattern 4: Search Pattern Modernization (MEDIUM/MEDIUM)

**Opportunity**: `.searchable()` outside `NavigationSplitView`, or `TabView` without a `Tab(role: .search)` tab, miss the platform-aligned search UX iOS 26 ships with.
**Search**:
- `\.searchable\(` not inside a `NavigationSplitView` block
- `TabView` with no `role:\s*\.search` in any of its `Tab`s
**Verify**: Read matching files; flag only when the screen has a search-as-primary-action pattern.
**Recommendation**: For tab-based apps, dedicate one tab with `Tab(role: .search)`; for split-view apps, place `.searchable` on the sidebar.

### Pattern 5: Glass-on-Glass Layering (MEDIUM/HIGH)

**Opportunity**: Nested views with multiple glass effects layer translucency, producing visual muddiness. Apply glass only to the outermost surface.
**Search**:
- `\.glassEffect\(` — count occurrences
- For each match, check if the parent view in the same file also applies a glass effect
**Verify**: Read matching files; trace the view hierarchy. If a card with `.glassEffect()` is inside an overlay with `.glassEffect()`, flag the inner one.
**Recommendation**: Remove the inner glass effect and keep only the outermost surface's glass. For sibling glass elements that sit close together, wrap them in a `GlassEffectContainer` instead.

### Pattern 6: Tinting Opportunities (LOW/MEDIUM)

**Opportunity**: A prominent button already fills with the accent color, so it needs no `.tint()` for prominence. The opportunity is semantic color: a prominent button whose meaning differs from the brand accent (a confirmation that should read green, a destructive action) still shows the accent color.
**Search**:
- `\.borderedProminent` or `\.glassProminent` not followed by `\.tint\(` on the same view chain
**Verify**: Read matching files; flag only prominent buttons whose action carries a meaning the accent color doesn't convey. For destructive actions, prefer `Button(role: .destructive)` over a hand-picked red.
**Recommendation**: A semantic tint such as `.tint(.green)` for a confirmation that must stand apart from the accent color. Don't add `.tint(.accentColor)`; it changes nothing.

### Pattern 7: Missing .interactive() on Custom Controls (LOW/LOW)

**Opportunity**: Custom tappable surfaces with glass but no interactive glass lose the press-state feedback the material provides.
**Search**:
- `\.glassEffect\(` on a Button/control or tap-handling view without `\.interactive\(` in its `Glass` argument
**Verify**: Read matching files; flag interactive surfaces (custom hit-testing views, gesture targets), not static cards. A standard `Button` is better served by `.buttonStyle(.glass)`.
**Recommendation**: `interactive()` is a method on `Glass`, not a view modifier: write `.glassEffect(.regular.interactive())`. For buttons, use `.buttonStyle(.glass)` or `.buttonStyle(.glassProminent)`.

### Pattern 8: Hand-Pinned Bars Over Scrolling Content (MEDIUM/MEDIUM)

**Opportunity**: A custom bar pinned over a `ScrollView`, `List`, or `Form` with `.overlay` or a `ZStack` doesn't inset the safe area, so the last rows can't scroll clear of the bar. `.safeAreaInset(edge:)` fixes the inset, but rows scrolling under the bar stay sharp, with no edge effect. `safeAreaBar(edge:)` (iOS 26) insets the safe area the same way and also extends the scroll view's edge effect under the bar — the separation system bars get on iOS 26 (`axiom-design (skills/liquid-glass.md)`, Scroll Edge Effects).
**Search**:
- `\.overlay\(alignment:\s*\.(bottom|top)` — overlays pinned to a vertical edge
- `ZStack\(alignment:\s*\.(bottom|top)` — a scroll view and a bar stacked together
- `\.safeAreaInset\(edge:\s*\.(bottom|top)` — insets that may hold a bar
**Verify**: Read matching files. Flag only when the scrolling view is a `ScrollView`, `List`, or `Form` (modified directly, or a sibling in the `ZStack`) and the pinned content is a bar: a row of controls, a composer, or a filter strip spanning the width, often with its own `.background(.bar)` or material. Skip a single floating button, a badge or toast, and views that don't scroll. If the scroll content already makes room for the bar — bottom `contentMargins`, `safeAreaPadding`, or trailing padding or a spacer after the last row — report only the missing edge effect, not clipped rows.
**Recommendation**: Ordinary actions belong in `ToolbarItem(placement: .bottomBar)` inside a `NavigationStack`. System bars get shared glass, and built with the 27.1 SDK only system bars move to the side on iPhone Duo (`axiom-swiftui (skills/iphone-duo.md)`, Vertical Bars). A mini player above a `TabView` belongs in `.tabViewBottomAccessory` (`axiom-swiftui (skills/nav-ref.md)` 5.7). Keep `safeAreaBar` for custom bars such as a message composer or a filter strip:
```swift
if #available(iOS 26, *) {
    list.safeAreaBar(edge: .bottom) { composer }
} else {
    list.safeAreaInset(edge: .bottom) { composer.background(.bar) }
}
```
Drop the bar's own background on the iOS 26 path: a `.bar` material inside `safeAreaBar` paints a flat band over the edge effect. For UIKit, add a `UIScrollEdgeElementContainerInteraction` (iOS 26) to the view containing the bar's controls, with its `scrollView` and `edge` set. It supplies the edge effect only; inset the scroll content separately, e.g. with the view controller's `additionalSafeAreaInsets`.

## Phase 3: Reason About Adoption Completeness

Using the Visual Treatment Map from Phase 1 and your domain knowledge, check for what's *missing or incomplete* — not just what's wrong.

| Question | What it detects | Why it matters |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Is `UIDesignRequiresCompatibility` set to YES? | App-wide design opt-out | iOS 26 users see compatibility mode, so no adoption finding is visible to them. The system ignores the key once the app builds with the 27 SDK and runs on OS 27 (already true if the project builds with Xcode 27), so the new design goes live on OS 27 whether or not it was reviewed. See `axiom-design (skills/liquid-glass.md)`, Backward Compatibility |
| If deployment target is below iOS 26, does every `if #available(iOS 26, *)` around a glass call have a designed `else` branch (e.g. `.background(.ultraThinMaterial)`) rather than an empty or unstyled one? | Bare pre-26 surfaces | The compiler already refuses an ungated `.glassEffect()` below the deployment target; what it can't catch is an `else` branch that ships an unstyled view to iOS 18 users |
| For glass surfaces over photos/videos/maps (media-heavy contexts), is the Clear variant (`.glassEffect(.clear)`) chosen rather than Regular? | Visual muddiness over media | Regular adds tint that distorts the underlying photo/video color; Clear preserves accuracy |
| For glass adoption, has the team verified contrast against accessibility audit baseline (text-on-glass meets WCAG)? | Accessibility regression | Glass surfaces can drop text contrast below 4.5:1; readers with low vision lose readability |
| Are nested visual surfaces flattened so only the outermost view applies glass? | Glass-on-glass mud | Stacked translucency turns into haze; the visual hierarchy reads as "everything is glass" instead of structured layers |
| For tab-based apps, does at least one tab use `Tab(role: .search)` to take advantage of iOS 26's bottom-aligned search? | Off-platform search UX | Custom search bars feel out of place against the system's bottom-aligned search treatment |
| Do sheet and editor toolbars place commit and dismiss actions with `.confirmationAction` / `.cancellationAction`, so the system applies prominent and standard glass? | Primary action invisibility | Positional placements get no automatic prominence; all toolbar items read as equally weighted and users guess which is the primary action |
| If the codebase mixes legacy `.material` with new `.glassEffect()` on the same screen, is there a visual review of the result? | Material/Glass mismatch | Regular + Clear variants combined with Material on the same screen reads as inconsistent design language |
| Are `.glassEffect()` adoption sites covered by visual regression tests (snapshot or screenshot tests on iOS 26 and iOS 18)? | Regression risk | Glass adoption can shift layout (different padding); without snapshot tests, subtle visual regressions ship |
| For custom controls with glass surfaces, is interactive glass (`.glassEffect(.regular.interactive())`) used so press states animate the material itself (not a separate overlay)? | Inert glass feedback | Without interactive glass, the surface stays static during taps; users get no material-aware feedback |
| Has the team established a glass-adoption rubric (which view types adopt glass, which keep solid surfaces) so adoption stays consistent across new screens? | Inconsistent adoption | Without a rubric, half the cards adopt glass and half don't; the design feels random |

Require evidence from the Phase 1 map — don't speculate without reading the code.

## Phase 4: Cross-Reference Adoption Compounds

Bump priority for these combinations:

| Finding A | + Finding B | = Compound | Priority |
|-----------|------------|-----------|----------|
| `UIDesignRequiresCompatibility` = YES (Phase 3) | Any adoption opportunity (Patterns 1–8) | Hidden from iOS 26 users but shipped unreviewed on OS 27 by the first 27-SDK build (already live if the project builds with Xcode 27); finish adoption before or with that SDK move | HIGH |
| Old `.material` on a floating surface (Pattern 1) | iOS 26+ deployment target with no `if #available` gate | Direct replacement, ship-ready | HIGH |
| Glass over media (Phase 3) | Regular variant chosen | Color distortion over photos/videos; switch to Clear immediately | HIGH |
| Glass adoption (Pattern 1/3) | No accessibility re-check | Contrast may drop below WCAG 4.5:1; flag for accessibility-auditor follow-up | HIGH |
| Multiple nested glass effects (Pattern 5) | Outer view also has glass | Mud; remove inner glass on every nested layer | HIGH |
| Positional commit/dismiss placement (Pattern 2) | Sheet or editor with Save / Done | Primary action invisible; use `.confirmationAction` / `.cancellationAction` | MEDIUM |
| Prominent button whose meaning differs from the accent (Pattern 6) | No semantic `.tint()` | Confirmation reads as an ordinary accent action | LOW |
| `.searchable` (Pattern 4) | TabView with no `Tab(role: .search)` | Off-platform search UX; promote one tab | MEDIUM |
| Custom container (Pattern 3) | Floats over content with visible chrome (RoundedRectangle background) | Likely glass candidate; list and content cards are not | MEDIUM |
| Glass adoption | Pre-iOS-26 deployment target with an empty or unstyled `else` branch | iOS 18 users see a bare surface where iOS 26 users see glass | MEDIUM |
| Mixed `.material` + `.glassEffect()` on same screen | No visual review | Inconsistent design language; the screen reads as "in transition" | MEDIUM |
| Custom interactive control with glass (Pattern 7) | Frequently tapped (button, hit area) | Missing `.interactive()` makes the surface feel inert | LOW |
Cross-auditor overlap notes:
- Glass adoption potentially dropping text contrast below WCAG → compound with `accessibility-auditor` (re-run after adoption)
- Heavy blur/glass layering on older devices → compound with `swift-performance-analyzer` and `swiftui-performance-analyzer` (frame-time impact)
- Legacy `.material` migration alongside `ObservableObject` → `Observable` migrations → compound with `modernization-helper`
- Glass-only API on a non-#available branch causing build failure on older Xcode → compound with `axiom-build`
- Adoption requires iOS 26 deployment target which may affect submission requirements → compound with `axiom-shipping`

## Phase 5: Liquid Glass Adoption Health Score

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Deployment target | iOS X.Y |
| Design opt-out | `UIDesignRequiresCompatibility` absent / NO / YES (compatibility mode on 26.x; ignored on OS 27 in 27-SDK builds) |
| Legacy effect sites | M UIBlurEffect/NSVisualEffectView/`.material` references |
| Glass adoption sites | N `.glassEffect` calls and glass button styles |
| Toolbar modernization | M of N sheet/editor toolbars use `.confirmationAction` / `.cancellationAction` (Z%) |
| Search alignment | TabView with `Tab(role: .search)` / NavigationSplitView `.searchable` / older pattern |
| Variant discipline | Regular for content / Clear for media — followed / mixed / unaware |
| Nesting hygiene | No glass-on-glass / some nesting / many nested |
| Pre-26 fallbacks | designed / partly unstyled / unstyled / N/A (iOS 26+ target) |
| Custom bars over scrolling content | `safeAreaBar` / mixed / `safeAreaInset` or `.overlay` only / no custom bars |
| **Adoption** | **ADOPTED / PARTIAL / NOT ADOPTED** |

Scoring (adoption progress, not danger):
- **ADOPTED**: Glass surfaces present on app chrome (toolbars, tabs, sidebars, primary containers), variant discipline followed (Regular for content, Clear for media), no glass-on-glass nesting, commit and dismiss actions use semantic toolbar placements, search uses `Tab(role: .search)` or split-view `.searchable`, custom bars over scrolling content use `safeAreaBar`, pre-26 fallbacks designed where needed, no compatibility opt-out. The app reads as a native iOS 26 app.
- **PARTIAL**: Some adoption (a few glass surfaces) but inconsistent — some toolbars modern and some legacy, mixed variants, some nesting, some unstyled fallbacks. The app reads as "in transition."
- **NOT ADOPTED**: No `.glassEffect` adoption, no toolbar modernization, no `Tab(role: .search)`. Custom surfaces still use pre-26 materials; only system chrome has glass, which it got automatically. With `UIDesignRequiresCompatibility` = YES, iOS 26 users don't see even that.

## Opportunities by Priority

### [PRIORITY] [Pattern Name]: [Description]
**File**: path/to/file.swift:line
**Phase**: [2: Detection | 3: Completeness | 4: Compound]
**Current**: What's there now
**Recommendation**: Code example showing the adoption (with availability gate if needed)
**Variant guidance**: Regular / Clear / N/A
**Cross-Auditor Notes**: [if overlapping with another auditor]

## Recommendations
1. [Immediate adoption — HIGH-priority items (compatibility opt-out with pending adoption, legacy blur on floating surfaces on iOS 26+, glass-on-glass mud, Regular glass over media)]
2. [Short-term — MEDIUM-priority adoption (semantic toolbar placement, custom floating views, search modernization, unstyled pre-26 fallbacks, hand-pinned bars moved to `safeAreaBar`); LOW items such as semantic tint]
3. [Long-term — completeness gaps from Phase 3 (accessibility re-check, snapshot tests on iOS 18 + iOS 26, glass-adoption rubric)]
4. [Test plan — visual regression on the iOS 18 fallback, accessibility contrast on glass surfaces, performance on older devices]
```

## Output Limits

If >50 opportunities in one category: Show top 10, provide total count, list top 3 files.
If >100 total opportunities: Summarize by category, show only HIGH/MEDIUM details.

## False Positives (Not Issues)

- Any material, including `.bar`, in the `else` branch of `if #available(iOS 26, *)` (legitimate pre-iOS 26 fallback)
- Material on content-layer backgrounds (cards in a list, section backgrounds); glass is for surfaces floating over content
- UIKit `UIBlurEffect` in legacy code paths the team has explicitly chosen not to migrate
- `.blur(radius:)` used for intentional blur effects (loading states, censoring, depth-of-field), not as a glass substitute
- Custom views that are text-only labels (no need for glass)
- Glass effects on sibling views (not nested in a parent that also has glass)
- `.glassBackgroundEffect()` in visionOS targets (the visionOS glass API, not an iOS adoption gap)
- `UIDesignRequiresCompatibility` set to NO, or absent
- Toolbars in deeply utility-only screens where prominence is undesired (e.g., Settings detail views)
- `.borderedProminent` / `.glassProminent` without `.tint()` on an ordinary primary action (the accent color is already the fill)
- `.overlay(alignment: .bottom)` / `.top`, or a `ZStack` with that alignment, holding a floating button, badge, or toast rather than a full-width bar, or over a view that doesn't scroll
- `.safeAreaInset(edge:)` in the `else` branch of `if #available(iOS 26, *)` (the pre-26 fallback for `safeAreaBar`)
