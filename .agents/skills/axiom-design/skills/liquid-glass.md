## What is Liquid Glass?

Liquid Glass is Apple's next-generation material design system introduced at WWDC 2025. It represents a significant evolution from previous materials (Aqua, iOS 7 blurs, Dynamic Island) by creating a new digital meta-material that:

- **Dynamically bends and shapes light** (lensing) rather than scattering it
- **Moves organically** like a lightweight liquid, responding to touch and app dynamism
- **Adapts automatically** to size, environment, content, and light/dark modes
- **Unifies design language** across Apple platforms (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS). The SwiftUI `glassEffect` API is unavailable on visionOS, which has its own glass material

**Core Philosophy**: Liquid Glass complements the evolution of rounded, immersive screens with rounded, floating forms that feel natural to touch interaction while letting content shine through.

---

## Visual Properties

### 1. Lensing (Primary Visual Characteristic)

Liquid Glass defines itself through **lensing** — warping and bending light to communicate presence, motion, and form. Elements materialize in/out by modulating light bending (not fading). Controls feel ultra-lightweight yet visually distinguishable.

### 2. Motion & Fluidity

- Responds to interaction by flexing with light
- Gel-like flexibility communicates transient, malleable nature
- Elements lift into Liquid Glass on interaction (controls)
- Dynamic morphing between app states as a singular floating plane

### 3. Adaptive Behavior

Liquid Glass **continuously adapts** without fixed light/dark appearance:
- Shadows intensify when text scrolls underneath; tint shifts for legibility
- Small elements (navbars) independently flip light/dark; large elements (menus, sidebars) don't flip but adapt depth
- Ambient environment subtly spills onto surface

---

## Implementation Guide

### Basic API Usage

#### The `glassEffect` Modifier

`glassEffect`, `Glass`, and `GlassEffectContainer` live in SwiftUICore (re-exported by `import SwiftUI`). There is a single overload: `glassEffect(_ glass: Glass = .regular, in shape: some Shape = DefaultGlassEffectShape())`.

```swift
// Basic usage — glass in the default shape (capsule-like)
Text("Hello")
    .glassEffect()

// Custom shape
Text("Hello")
    .glassEffect(in: RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 12))

// Interactive glass — interactive() and tint() are methods on Glass,
// NOT standalone view modifiers
Button("Tap Me") { /* action */ }
    .glassEffect(.regular.interactive())
```

`Glass` has exactly three base values — `.regular`, `.clear`, `.identity` — plus the chainable instance methods `.tint(_ color: Color?)` and `.interactive(_ isEnabled: Bool = true)`. There are no material-named variants (no `.thin`/`.thick`).

For buttons, prefer the dedicated glass button styles over a raw `glassEffect`:

```swift
Button("Add") { }.buttonStyle(.glass)            // GlassButtonStyle
Button("Buy") { }.buttonStyle(.glassProminent)   // GlassProminentButtonStyle
Button("Tag") { }.buttonStyle(.glass(.regular.tint(.blue)))  // tinted glass
```

**Automatic Adoption**: Simply recompiling with Xcode 26 brings Liquid Glass to standard controls automatically.

### Variants: Regular vs Clear

**CRITICAL DECISION**: Never mix Regular and Clear in the same interface.

#### Regular Variant (Default — 95% of Cases)

Most versatile. Full adaptive effects, automatic legibility, works in any size over any content. Use for navigation bars, tab bars, toolbars, buttons, menus, sidebars.

#### Clear Variant (Special Cases Only)

Permanently more transparent, no adaptive behaviors. **Requires dimming layer** for legibility.

**Use ONLY when ALL three conditions are met**:
1. Element is over **media-rich content**
2. Content layer won't be negatively affected by **dimming layer**
3. Content above glass is **bold and bright**

Using Clear without meeting all three conditions results in poor legibility. See `axiom-design (skills/liquid-glass-ref.md)` for implementation examples.

---

## Layered System Architecture

Liquid Glass is composed of four layers working together:

1. **Highlights** — Light sources produce highlights responding to geometry; some respond to device motion
2. **Shadows** — Content-aware: stronger over text, weaker over light backgrounds
3. **Internal Glow** — Material illuminates from within on interaction; spreads to nearby glass elements
4. **Adaptive Tinting** — Multiple layers adapt together to maintain hierarchy; all built-in automatically

---

## Scroll Edge Effects

Scroll edge effects dissolve content into background as it scrolls, lifting glass above moving content. Use `.scrollEdgeEffectStyle(.hard, for: .top)` when pinned accessory views exist (e.g., column headers) for extra visual separation. See `axiom-design (skills/liquid-glass-ref.md)` for full API details.

---

## Tinting & Color

Liquid Glass introduces **adaptive tinting** — selecting a color generates tones mapped to content brightness underneath, inspired by colored glass in reality. Compatible with all glass behaviors (morphing, adaptation, interaction).

### Tinting Rules

```swift
// ✅ Tint primary actions only — tint the glass material via Glass.tint()
Button("View Bag") { }.glassEffect(.regular.tint(.red))

// ❌ Don't tint everything — when everything is tinted, nothing stands out
VStack {
    Button("Action 1").glassEffect(.regular.tint(.blue))
    Button("Action 2").glassEffect(.regular.tint(.green))  // No hierarchy
}

// ❌ Solid fills break Liquid Glass character
Button("Action") { }.background(.red)  // Opaque, wrong

// ✅ Tint the glass instead of solid fills
Button("Action") { }.glassEffect(.regular.tint(.red))  // Grounded in environment
```

Reserve tinting for primary UI actions. Use color in the content layer for overall app color scheme.

---

## Legibility & Contrast

SwiftUI automatically uses **vibrant text and tint colors** within glass effects — no manual adjustment needed. Small elements (navbars, tabbars) flip light/dark for discernibility. Large elements (menus, sidebars) adapt but don't flip (too distracting for large surface area). Symbols/glyphs mirror glass behavior and maximize contrast automatically.

Use custom tint colors selectively for distinct functional purpose (e.g., `.tint(.orange)` on a single toolbar button for emphasis).

---

## Accessibility

Liquid Glass offers several accessibility features that modify material **without sacrificing its magic**:

### Reduced Transparency
- Makes Liquid Glass frostier
- Obscures more content behind it
- Applied automatically when system setting enabled

### Increased Contrast
- Makes elements predominantly black or white
- Highlights with contrasting border
- Applied automatically when system setting enabled

### Reduced Motion
- Decreases intensity of effects
- Disables elastic properties
- Applied automatically when system setting enabled

**Developer Action Required**: None - all features available automatically when using Liquid Glass.

---

## Performance Considerations

### View Hierarchy Impact

**Concern**: Liquid Glass rendering cost in complex view hierarchies

**Guidance**:
- Regular variant optimized for performance
- Larger elements (menus, sidebars) use more pronounced effects but managed by system
- Avoid excessive nesting of glass elements

**Optimization**:
```swift
// ❌ Avoid deep nesting
ZStack {
    GlassContainer1()
        .glassEffect()
    ZStack {
        GlassContainer2()
            .glassEffect()
        // More nesting...
    }
}

// ✅ Flatten hierarchy
VStack {
    GlassContainer1()
        .glassEffect()

    GlassContainer2()
        .glassEffect()
}
```

### Rendering Costs

**Adaptive behaviors have computational cost**:
- Light/dark switching
- Shadow adjustments
- Tint calculations
- Lensing effects

**System handles optimization**, but be mindful:
- Don't animate Liquid Glass elements unnecessarily
- Use Clear variant sparingly (requires dimming layer computation)
- Profile with Instruments if experiencing performance issues

---

## Testing Liquid Glass

Test across these configurations:
- Light/dark modes
- Reduced Transparency enabled
- Increased Contrast enabled
- Reduced Motion enabled
- Dynamic Type (larger text sizes)
- Content scrolling (verify scroll edge effects)
- Right-to-left languages

See `axiom-testing` (ui-testing reference) for comprehensive UI testing patterns including visual regression and accessibility testing.

## Design Review Pressure: Defending Your Implementation

### The Problem

Under design review pressure, you'll face requests to:
- "Use Clear variant everywhere — Regular is too opaque"
- "Glass on all controls for visual cohesion"
- "More transparency to let content shine through"

These sound reasonable. **But they violate the framework.** Your job: defend using evidence, not opinion.

### Red Flags — Designer Requests That Violate Skill Guidelines

If you hear ANY of these, **STOP and reference the skill**:

- ❌ **"Use Clear everywhere"** – Clear requires three specific conditions, not design preference
- ❌ **"Glass looks better than fills"** – Correct layer (navigation vs content) trumps aesthetics
- ❌ **"Users won't notice the difference"** – Clear variant fails legibility tests in low-contrast scenarios
- ❌ **"Stack glass on glass for consistency"** – Explicitly prohibited; use fills instead
- ❌ **"Apply glass to Lists for sophistication"** – Lists are content layer; causes visual confusion

### How to Push Back Professionally

#### Step 1: Show the Framework

```
"I want to make this change, but let me show you Apple's guidance on Clear variant.
It requires THREE conditions:

1. Media-rich content background
2. Dimming layer for legibility
3. Bold, bright controls on top

Let me show which screens meet all three..."
```

#### Step 2: Demonstrate the Risk

Open the app on a device. Show:
- Clear variant in low-contrast scenario (unreadable)
- Regular variant in same scenario (legible)

#### Step 3: Offer Compromise

```
"Clear can work beautifully in these 6 hero sections where all three conditions apply.
Regular handles everything else with automatic legibility. Best of both worlds."
```

#### Step 4: Document the Decision

If overruled (designer insists on Clear everywhere):

```
Slack message to PM + designer:

"Design review decided to use Clear variant across all controls.
Important: Clear variant requires legibility testing in low-contrast scenarios
(bright sunlight, dark content). If we see accessibility issues after launch,
we'll need an expedited follow-up. I'm flagging this proactively."
```

#### Why this works
- You're not questioning their taste (you like Clear too)
- You're raising accessibility/legibility risk
- You're offering a solution that preserves their vision in hero sections
- You're documenting the decision (protects you post-launch)

### Real-World Example: App Store Launch Blocker (36-Hour Deadline)

#### Scenario
- 36 hours to launch
- Chief designer says: "Clear variant everywhere"
- Client watching the review meeting
- You already implemented Regular per the skill

#### What to do

```swift
// In the meeting, demo side-by-side:

// Regular variant (current implementation)
NavigationBar()
    .glassEffect() // Automatic legibility

// Clear variant (requested)
NavigationBar()
    .glassEffect(.clear) // Requires dimming layer below

// Show the three-condition checklist
// Demonstrate which screens pass/fail
// Offer: Clear in hero sections, Regular elsewhere
```

#### Result
- 30-minute compromise demo
- 90 minutes to implement changes
- Launch on schedule with optimal legibility
- No post-launch accessibility complaints

### When to Accept the Design Decision (Even If You Disagree)

Sometimes designers have valid reasons to override the skill. Accept if:

- [ ] They understand the three-condition framework
- [ ] They're willing to accept legibility risks
- [ ] You document the decision in writing
- [ ] They commit to monitoring post-launch feedback

#### Document in Slack

```
"Design review decided to use Clear variant [in these locations].
We understand this requires:
- All three conditions met: [list them]
- Potential legibility issues in low-contrast scenarios
- Accessibility testing across brightness levels

Monitoring plan:
- Gather user feedback first 48 hours
- Run accessibility audit
- Have fallback to Regular variant ready for push if needed"
```

This protects both of you and shows you're not blocking - just de-risking.

## Expert Review Checklist

When reviewing Liquid Glass implementation (your code or others'), check:

### 1. Material Appropriateness
- [ ] Is Liquid Glass used only on navigation layer (not content)?
- [ ] Are standard controls getting glass automatically via Xcode 26 recompile?
- [ ] Is glass avoided on glass situations?

### 2. Variant Selection
- [ ] Is Regular variant used for most cases?
- [ ] If Clear variant used, do all three conditions apply?
  - [ ] Over media-rich content?
  - [ ] Dimming layer acceptable?
  - [ ] Content above is bold and bright?
- [ ] Are Regular and Clear never mixed in same interface?

### 3. Legibility & Contrast
- [ ] Are primary actions selectively tinted (not everything)?
- [ ] Is color used in content layer for overall app color scheme?
- [ ] Are solid fills avoided on glass elements?
- [ ] Do elements maintain legibility on various backgrounds?

### 4. Layering & Hierarchy
- [ ] Are content intersections avoided in steady states?
- [ ] Are elements on top of glass using fills/transparency (not glass)?
- [ ] Is visual hierarchy clear (navigation layer vs content layer)?

### 5. Scroll Edge Effects
- [ ] Are scroll edge effects applied where Liquid Glass meets scrolling content?
- [ ] Is hard style used for pinned accessory views?

### 6. Accessibility
- [ ] Does implementation work with Reduced Transparency?
- [ ] Does implementation work with Increased Contrast?
- [ ] Does implementation work with Reduced Motion?
- [ ] Are interactive elements hittable in all configurations?

### 7. Performance
- [ ] Is view hierarchy reasonably flat?
- [ ] Are glass elements animated only when necessary?
- [ ] Is Clear variant used sparingly?

## Common Mistakes & Solutions

### Glass Placement Errors

```swift
// ❌ Glass on content layer — competes with navigation
List(landmarks) { landmark in
    LandmarkRow(landmark).glassEffect()
}

// ✅ Glass on navigation layer only
.toolbar {
    ToolbarItem { Button("Add") { }.glassEffect() }
}

// ❌ Clear without dimming — poor legibility
ZStack {
    VideoPlayer(player: player)
    PlayButton().glassEffect(.clear)
}

// ✅ Clear with dimming layer
ZStack {
    VideoPlayer(player: player)
        .overlay(.black.opacity(0.4))
    PlayButton().glassEffect(.clear)
}
```

### Over-Tinting

Tint primary action only. When everything is tinted, nothing stands out.

### Static Material Expectations

Don't hardcode shadows or fixed opacity. Embrace adaptive behavior — test across light/dark modes and backgrounds.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Visual Artifacts

**Issue**: Glass appears too transparent or invisible

**Check**:
1. Are you using Clear variant? (Switch to Regular if inappropriate)
2. Is background content extremely light or dark? (Glass adapts - this may be correct behavior)
3. Is Reduced Transparency enabled? (Check accessibility settings)

**Issue**: Glass appears opaque or has harsh edges

**Check**:
1. Are you using solid fills on glass? (Remove, use tinting)
2. Is Increased Contrast enabled? (Expected behavior)
3. Is custom shape too complex? (Simplify geometry)

### Dark Mode Issues

**Issue**: Glass doesn't flip to dark style on dark backgrounds

**Check**:
1. Is element large (menu, sidebar)? (Large elements don't flip - by design)
2. Is background actually dark? (Use Color Picker to verify)
3. Are you overriding appearance? (Remove `.preferredColorScheme()` if unintended)

**Issue**: Content on glass not legible in dark mode

**Fix**:
```swift
// Let SwiftUI handle contrast automatically
Text("Label")
    .foregroundStyle(.primary) // ✅ Adapts automatically

// Don't hardcode colors
Text("Label")
    .foregroundColor(.black) // ❌ Won't adapt to dark mode
```

### Performance Issues

**Issue**: Scrolling feels janky with Liquid Glass

**Debug**:
1. Profile with Instruments (see `axiom-swiftui` performance reference)
2. Check for excessive view body updates
3. Simplify view hierarchy under glass
4. Verify not applying glass to content layer (major performance hit)

**Issue**: Animations stuttering

**Check**:
1. Are you animating glass shape changes? (Expensive)
2. Profile with SwiftUI Instrument for long view updates
3. Consider reducing glass usage if critical path

## Known iOS 26 Limitations

Documented platform behaviors with no reliable fix from user code as of iOS 26.0/26.1 — not implementation mistakes. Listed here so you don't burn time chasing fixes that don't exist.

### SwiftUI TabView / nav bar floating pill stuck in wrong glass variant

**Symptom**: The floating tab-bar or nav-bar pill renders in the darker scroll-edge variant on cold start, after a navigation pop-back, or after a tab switch — then snaps to the correct lighter variant only after a ~1pt physical scroll triggers an appearance-state transition. Most visible against bright, saturated backgrounds (e.g. a teal `#129487`); effectively imperceptible in dark mode.

**Status**: Documented on iOS 26.0 (24A343); no reliable fix from user code as of iOS 26.0/26.1. The new SwiftUI floating pill resists both `.toolbarBackground` and `UIAppearance` overrides.

**Workarounds** (tradeoffs, not fixes):
- Match the launch-screen color to your app background — papers over the cold-start flash only; does nothing for the pop-back or tab-switch cases.
- Set `UIDesignRequiresCompatibility=true` — forces the pre-Liquid-Glass appearance but disables Liquid Glass app-wide (heavy hammer, and ignored on iOS 27 once the app builds with the 27 SDK; see the UIDesignRequiresCompatibility section under Backward Compatibility below).

**Do not reach for `UITabBar.appearance()`**: `UITabBar.appearance().standardAppearance` was the iOS 15–25 escape hatch for forcing SwiftUI `TabView` bar appearance. On iOS 26's floating pill this bridge is unreliable — the new render path does not consistently honor the proxy — so it is a dead end here, not a workaround.

Distinct (fixable) issue — don't conflate the two: `.toolbarBackground(_:for: .tabBar)` applied *at the TabView level* is a no-op; apply it on each Tab's content instead (see `axiom-swiftui (skills/26-ref.md)`). That placement fix controls the bar's background/color — it does **not** correct the wrong-glass-variant bug above, which no modifier fixes.

## Migration from Previous Materials

### From UIBlurEffect / NSVisualEffectView

**Before** (UIKit):
```swift
let blurEffect = UIBlurEffect(style: .systemMaterial)
let blurView = UIVisualEffectView(effect: blurEffect)
view.addSubview(blurView)
```

**After** (SwiftUI with Liquid Glass):
```swift
ZStack {
    // Content
}
.glassEffect()
```

**Benefits**: Automatic adaptation (no manual style switching), built-in interaction feedback, platform-appropriate appearance, accessibility features included.

### From Custom Materials

1. **Try Liquid Glass first** — may provide desired effect automatically
2. **Evaluate Regular vs Clear** — Clear may match custom transparency needs
3. **Test across configurations** — Liquid Glass adapts automatically

**When to keep custom materials**: Specific artistic effect not achievable with Liquid Glass, backward compatibility with iOS < 26 required, or non-standard UI paradigm incompatible with Liquid Glass principles.

### UIKit + SwiftUI Interop

When migrating incrementally, glass effects apply per-framework:
- SwiftUI views get `.glassEffect()`, grouped with `GlassEffectContainer` (note: `glassBackgroundEffect()` is a visionOS-only API, not available on iOS/macOS)
- UIKit views use the UIKit Liquid Glass APIs (see `axiom-design (skills/liquid-glass-ref.md)` for migration mapping)
- Hosted SwiftUI views inside `UIHostingController` get glass effects independently

See `axiom-design (skills/liquid-glass-ref.md)` for complete UIBlurEffect migration mapping table.

---

## Backward Compatibility

### UIDesignRequiresCompatibility Key

A temporary opt-out from the new design (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS 26):

```xml
<key>UIDesignRequiresCompatibility</key>
<true/>
```

**Effect**: the system runs the app in a UI compatibility mode, so it looks as it did when built against earlier SDKs; system bars and controls use their previous styles.

**Building with the 27 SDK turns the key off on OS 27.** Apple's documentation: "The system ignores this key when you build for iOS 27 or later, iPadOS 27 or later, Mac Catalyst 27 or later, macOS 27 or later, or tvOS 27 or later." What decides it is the SDK the app links together with the OS it runs on, not the deployment target. Measured on iPhone simulators with the key set; the 26 SDK row is an emulated 26-SDK build (the binary's Mach-O SDK version rewritten with `vtool`, minimum OS unchanged):

| Built with | Runs on iOS 26.5 | Runs on iOS 27.0 |
|---|---|---|
| 26 SDK | compatibility mode | compatibility mode |
| 27 SDK | compatibility mode | new design, key ignored |

Consequences:
- Updating to Xcode 27 ends the opt-out for iOS 27 users. Finish adopting the new design before or with that SDK update, not after.
- A 27-SDK app that keeps the key shows compatibility mode on iOS 26 and the new design on iOS 27, so it ships two appearances; test both. Code that needs the new design (navigation subtitles don't render in compatibility mode) runs only under `#available(iOS 27, *)` while the key remains, with a fallback on 26.x.
- Staying on the 26 SDK only postpones this. App Store Connect periodically raises the minimum SDK required for uploads, and the first update built with the 27 SDK loses compatibility mode on OS 27.

**Migration strategy**:
1. While on the 26 SDK, ship with the key only if you need time; audit in a build without it
2. Update the interface incrementally, then remove the key
3. Complete adoption before or with the move to the 27 SDK, where the key stops applying on OS 27
